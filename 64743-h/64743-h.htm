<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SERMON
I.<br />
TAKING THOUGHT FOR TEMPORAL THINGS.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Matthew</span>, <span class="smcap">vi</span>., 24, 25.</p>
<p>. . . &ldquo;Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your
body, what ye shall put on.&rdquo; . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one who has thoughtfully read
that description of the Samaritans in the second book of
Kings&mdash;&ldquo;they feared the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and served their own
gods&rdquo;&mdash;must have been struck with the mockery, the
blasphemy, the absurdity of such a fear.&nbsp; Fear Him, who
claims to be the only <span class="smcap">God</span>, and yet
regard many others as equally and independently gods!&nbsp;
Worship Him, all whose service is pure, and innocent, and
self-emptying, and righteous and yet worship Ashtaroth, the
goddess of licentious pleasure&mdash;Moloch, the god of
cruelty&mdash;Chemosh, and his abominations&mdash;Belial, and his
worldliness!&nbsp; This, my brethren, we all see is not simply a
<i>forbidden</i> but an <i>impossible</i> service.&nbsp; The
commands, the sanctions, the promises, the service of Jehovah,
and of any one of these others, are so thoroughly opposite, so
condemnatory of each other, that the <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>man who attempts to observe them both,
is far more impious and more foolish than the benighted heathen
who carves an idol out of a block of wood or piece of stone and
bows down to it alone in homage, and looks up only to it for
blessings.&nbsp; If, then, mammon means a false god&mdash;either
a deified human being, or a personified vice or virtue, or an
actual dumb, senseless idol,&mdash;we feel that Christ has
rightly said, not ye &ldquo;<i>shall</i> not,&rdquo; but ye
&ldquo;cannot&rdquo; serve it and <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; There is no room for the question
whether <span class="smcap">God</span> will wink at a divided
homage; whether, provided He is <i>one</i> of the objects of
worship, He will not be over-severe with you for having other
objects.&nbsp; The attempt to serve both is an attempt at what is
impossible; not at what may not be, on account of certain
commands and restrictions, but at what cannot be from the very
nature of things.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>
altogether&mdash;or mammon altogether, if you will; but &ldquo;ye
cannot serve <span class="smcap">God</span> and
mammon.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see this, you approve Christ&rsquo;s
teaching, you are ready to condemn, you do now condemn&mdash;the
impiety, the folly of attempting to serve <span
class="smcap">God</span> and mammon.</p>
<p>But, my brethren, consider.&nbsp; Do you know what and whom
you condemn?&nbsp; Are you quite sure that you do not yourselves
attempt to serve mammon as well as <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Oh, yes! you are quite
sure!&nbsp; Mammon, a false god&mdash;a name without a being like
Jove and Mars, like fairies and genii&mdash;or a substance
without life&mdash;like Bel of the <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Chaldeans, or Juggernaut of the
Hindoos&mdash;you are not so senseless as to serve this!</p>
<p>Or, again, if mammon be, as some commentators tell us, only a
personification of riches, and his service therefore be the
immoderate pursuit of wealth and worldly aggrandisement, still
you are free.&nbsp; You may sometimes make great efforts to be
rich, you may often desire and covet wealth; but you are not
sordid misers; you are not engrossed in the pursuit of wealth;
you do not treat it as a god, and give to it the thought and
homage due to Jehovah.</p>
<p>Dear brethren, it is not so certain that you could quite clear
yourselves of the sin and folly of serving mammon, even if this
were all that is meant.&nbsp; But it is not.&nbsp; Look to the
text, &ldquo;Ye cannot serve <span class="smcap">God</span> and
mammon.&rdquo;&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Why give up mammon!&nbsp;
And what is mammon?&nbsp; The next verse tells you,
&ldquo;Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life,
what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, then, taking thought for
these things is serving mammon.</p>
<p>Who is free from idolatry now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; some are ready to exclaim, &ldquo;taking
thought for these things is a very law and necessity of my
being.&nbsp; I came into this world needing food and
clothing.&nbsp; Others had to take thought to feed and clothe
me.&nbsp; They early impressed upon me as one of the clearest
duties of my responsible life that I should take this thought for
myself, and <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>now I can only get these things for myself and my family
by taking thought for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, and the very Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span> enjoins the duty: &ldquo;Go to the
ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways and be
wise&rdquo;&mdash;learn, that is, from her forethought and
provision; look about thee, be industrious, store up for future
wants.&nbsp; Our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself set the
example of such forethought, when He committed the care of a bag
to one of His disciples, that food, and money to buy food, might
be carried about with them; and the Apostle Paul plainly
taught&mdash;&ldquo;If any will not work, neither shall he
eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man provide not for his own, he
has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My brethren, the law of nature has imposed, and the Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span> therefore approves, that we should
look about and provide for our necessities.&nbsp; Wherever there
is power to do this, the power must be exercised, or we must run
the risk of want.&nbsp; The lilies of the field are fed by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> own hand with nourishment, which
they cannot seek.&nbsp; The unfledged bird has but to open its
mouth to receive the food, which divinely implanted instinct has
caused the parent to bring; but when it is grown it must itself
make provision&mdash;it must search the trees for berries and the
earth for worms, or it must die of starvation.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> takes thought for sparrows, yet He
requires, if I may so speak, that they should think for
themselves; and thereby He teaches us, confirming this teaching
by plain words of revelation, that it is incumbent upon us to
make provision for our <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>necessities, and so, of course, to
<i>think</i> about them.&nbsp; But <i>thinking</i> is not
<i>taking thought</i>.&nbsp; When our Bible was translated, to
&ldquo;take thought&rdquo; meant (as the Greek word which it
represents does) to be anxious, troubled, perplexed about a
thing, and so to be drawn off by its consideration from other
thoughts, and cares, and duties.&nbsp; The consistent, devoted
servant of <span class="smcap">God</span>, while intent upon his
due and loved service, may and should use precaution and
diligence to sustain in appointed ways the lower life and wants
of himself and his; but if he takes thought about them, cares
more or thinks more about temporal things than spiritual; if he
leaves undone religious duties, or transgresses divine commands,
or wears out his zeal, or consumes his time (of choice) in
securing or seeking worldly provision, then does he attempt to
serve mammon as well as <span class="smcap">God</span>, and in so
doing&mdash;attempting what cannot be&mdash;he actually foregoes
the service of <span class="smcap">God</span> and becomes an
idolater.</p>
<p>My dear brethren, let us go into this matter, and pick out its
plain and wholesome lessons, and ask <span
class="smcap">God</span> to engrave them deeply on our
hearts.&nbsp; The text is especially addressed to such as we
are.&nbsp; It is not mainly for the grossly covetous; for the
would-be hoarders of great wealth; for the epicure, intent upon
dainty dishes and costly wines; for the giddy votaries of
fashion, ever meditating fresh extravagancies and greater
absurdities, betraying by their silly, unchristian finery the
emptiness of their minds and the callousness of their hearts, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>making
themselves gazing-stocks to the thoughtless and objects of pity
to the thoughtful.&nbsp; It is not, I say, <i>chiefly</i> for
these (though it is indeed <i>for</i> them, and it behoves them
to regard it very seriously), but it is for those who take
thought for necessaries that our text was spoken and written; who
are in concern not for a superabundance, but for a sufficiency of
the things of this life.&nbsp; To them it says, Take no thought,
be not anxious, perplexed.&nbsp; Let not these things engross
your hearts, or cause you in any way to swerve from the pure and
entire service of <span class="smcap">God</span>, for&mdash;this
is the first reason&mdash;to do so is to sin, it is to give up
<span class="smcap">God</span> and choose mammon.&nbsp; Ye who do
it are idolaters.&nbsp; Make no plea of opposing difficulty or
necessity, count upon no indulgence.&nbsp; If you serve mammon,
you do not serve <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> will have no part of a divided heart,
and will not be served at all by those who do not serve Him
altogether.</p>
<p>Dear brethren, try to embrace this truth.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> commands are not to be explained
away, nor are excuses to be made for disregarding them.&nbsp;
Obey them at all hazards&mdash;do not pare them down by pleas of
expediency.&nbsp; Doubtless, the service is a very hard
one.&nbsp; It is very difficult not to take thought for immediate
and pressing wants.&nbsp; It is a great temptation to a very poor
man to have an opportunity of making a few shillings by working
or keeping his shop open on the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> Day.&nbsp; It is a great
temptation to one who is hard-worked during the week to have the
power of turning the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>day of holy rest into one of worldly pleasure.&nbsp; It
would be very convenient to the man of business to make up his
ledger when he should be reading his Bible; to be thinking of his
projects and prospects in this life rather than his coming
eternity; to be pushing a bargain which is very advantageous,
though it is a little unjust; to get what he <i>can</i> for his
goods, rather than what he <i>ought</i>; to tell little untruths;
to grind down his dependents; to withhold from charitable
purposes the money which can be made useful for self; in short,
to be ever taking thought for temporal things and not taking
thought for spiritual, and so to miss opportunities of
meditating, and reading, and praying, of worshipping, and
communicating, and doing good, and preparing for heaven.&nbsp;
The comparatively well-to-do man doubtless finds this worldly
taking thought agreeable and in a sense advantageous; the poor
man is hard pressed to give way to it; but still the command of
<span class="smcap">God</span> stands out&mdash;&ldquo;Take no
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not say you must&mdash;you <i>must not</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wants,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;must be relieved; my
family must be fed and clothed; my work must be done; my
interests must be looked after; my health must be
preserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, brethren, there is no <i>must</i> in
any one of these.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> must be
served; all the others may be, if they can be included in His
service, not otherwise.</p>
<p>And would you really come to want, if you were more
religious?&nbsp; Would your family be left unprovided for?&nbsp;
Would your health suffer?&nbsp; You do not <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>seriously think
it would.&nbsp; But what if it did?&nbsp; Welcome want, welcome
sickness, welcome death&mdash;anything rather than worldly
prosperity, if it can only be obtained by renunciation of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> enjoined service and idolatrous
devotion to mammon.&nbsp; The world will laugh at such preaching,
brethren, and call it foolishness; but the world is nothing to
us.&nbsp; It is doomed to pass away with all the things in it
which lure us to take thought; but you and I must live on to
eternity, and how we are to live shall be decided by the master
we serve&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span> or mammon.</p>
<p>A second reason why we are not to take thought is&mdash;that
doing so will not insure what we want.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which of you
by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature;&rdquo; or,
rather, such is the real meaning, can increase, even by a little
measure, the length of his life.&nbsp; And, on the other hand,
avoiding taking thought (from religious motives) <i>will</i>
insure what we want.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of
<span class="smcap">God</span> and His righteousness, and all
these things shall be added unto you;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, you
shall not want (no more is promised here) food and raiment.&nbsp;
At first thought, doubtless some of you fancy that your
experience contradicts both these divine statements.&nbsp; You
know many men who by taking thought have secured ample provision,
have apparently even added to their lives, and you think you know
some who have trusted in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
promise and fulfilled its conditions and yet suffered grievous
want.&nbsp; That some&mdash;yea, that many&mdash;by taking <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>thought have
secured what they wanted, is notorious; but that others, who have
taken equal thought, have failed, is also notorious.&nbsp; Can
you count the disappointed ambitious? the thwarted seekers of
pleasure? the distressed hard-working? the bankrupts who have
devoted every thought and effort, soul and body, to
business?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Well then taking thought does not
insure what we want.</p>
<p>And, on the other hand, though a Lazarus is <i>sometimes</i>
fed with crumbs only, if you knew the inner life of the seeming
waiters on <span class="smcap">God</span> who are in want, you
would nearly always find that their necessity remains unrelieved,
because they have not thoroughly performed the prescribed
conditions; or that it was in some fit of independence, by some
forbidden taking thought that they overreached themselves and
fell.&nbsp; In proportion as any one has opportunity to
investigate the causes of distress, he will surely be more and
more ready to confirm the testimony of a great
observer:&mdash;&ldquo;I have been young and now am old, and yet
saw I never the righteous forsaken or his seed begging their
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what, then, are we to infer from all this?&nbsp; That
besides <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> general providence
which rules over all, ordering, as from a distant throne, the
being and motions of the universe, He exercises a particular
providence, drawing nigh to individuals, stepping in between
cause and effect, saving, helping, prospering, hindering,
confounding, destroying, just in those very cases which natural
laws would <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>treat otherwise.&nbsp; Not that this is always done in
the case of all men.&nbsp; The wicked are often and chiefly let
alone; they are, it may be, in great prosperity for a time; they
come perhaps to no present misfortune; they do violence and
escape justice; their time of reward is not yet.&nbsp; Again, the
righteous are not exempt from trials, and troubles, and
privations&mdash;their time of reward is not yet (and if it were,
their very trials, in the spiritual effects they produce, may be
part of their blessedness); but they are never forsaken.&nbsp;
The very hairs of their heads are all numbered.&nbsp; Nothing
befalls them but by <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
permission&mdash;a permission which is only given when the event
will work for their good.&nbsp; They may commit themselves unto
Him as unto a faithful Creator and most merciful Saviour; they
may put their trust in Him, assured that it will not miscarry; no
evil shall approach to hurt them lastingly&mdash;He will keep
them as the apple of His eye; none shall be able to pluck them
out of His hand.&nbsp; In short, while they desire the things
which He promises, and love and do the things which He commands,
He will forward all their wise undertakings, and bless them in
all their circumstances; and when their own ignorance, or want of
forethought, or external so-called chances, or the machinations
of evil men or spirits expose them to danger, He will interfere
and ward off the consequences, save only when, like the trials of
Job or Joseph, they can be made productive of greater excellence
and so of greater reward.&nbsp; If this be so, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>then surely
expediency approves what right demands, that we should forego the
taking thought which is so uncertainly successful, and that we
should repose in a care which never fails&mdash;&ldquo;Casting
all your care upon Him for He careth for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! my brethren, try to believe heartily this great doctrine
of a particular Providence!&nbsp; Look not back to the creation
of the world, and to the working out of men&rsquo;s redemption in
Judea, or forward to the Judgment Day, as though <span
class="smcap">God</span> were only working and manifesting
Himself there and then.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is
everywhere and is active everywhere; He is here now; He is
marking how we conduct ourselves in this house; He is looking
into the very depths of our hearts and minds, and noting
whatsoever lurks there.&nbsp; This night He will be about our
beds; to-morrow about our paths; always spying out all our
ways.&nbsp; Of every thought, of every word, of every deed of
ours, He will at once note the intent and the measure.&nbsp; Of
all that is done in His fear and service, He will record that it
is &ldquo;righteous worship;&rdquo; of all else that it is
&ldquo;idolatry,&rdquo; the setting up of some person or some
thing as more worthy to be loved or feared than He is.&nbsp;
Every undertaking, every endurance, all safety and all danger,
all wisdom and all folly, will be watched and allowed or
overruled according as we deserve or deserve not to be dealt with
in love by a present <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Oh! if we felt this, how easy would it be to avoid taking
thought for temporal things! how <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>full would be our minds of <span
class="smcap">God</span>! how should we breathe as in His
presence, and listen for His guidance, and trust in His
providence!&nbsp; And then how determined would be our service of
Him!&nbsp; We should not talk of expediency; we should not invent
excuses; we should not do evil that good may come, or avoid good
that we may escape unpleasant circumstances.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span> would be indeed <span
class="smcap">God</span>; religion would be the one thing
needful; we should hope for what it promised, and fear what it
threatened.&nbsp; The allurements of the world, the offers of
pleasure, riches, power, honour, would be scorned as childish
toys idly held out to sage and sober men.&nbsp; The scoffs, the
sneers, the threats, the persecutions of the world would be
nothing cared for&mdash;they would be as the impotent threats of
chained madmen.</p>
<p>Serve God or mammon?&nbsp; Who would be in doubt which to do,
who would shrink from or fail in the service, if <span
class="smcap">God</span> were only thus palpably present?&nbsp;
Having thus set <span class="smcap">God</span> before us, how
zealously should we serve Him, how confidently should we rest on
Him!</p>
<p>And, lastly, what men of prayer we should become.&nbsp; If we
felt that <span class="smcap">God</span> is indeed an interfering
power in the world; that His superintendence is not general only
but special also; that He may at any time avert a threatened
danger, or confer an improbable blessing; that, in short, He may
alter the whole face of things, and their working upon us and
ours on them at any moment, and that our <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>doings, our
yearnings, our prayers may prompt His interference; then would
not prayer cease to be regarded as a mere necessary religious
exercise, to be gone through much as grace before and after meat
is; would it not become a vivid recital of our wants and
feelings, an earnest pleading, a very wrestling with <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Would not every event, every
shadow of weal or wo bring us to our knees?&nbsp; Should we make
any plans or enter upon any course, or indulge any thoughts,
before we had laid all before Him?&nbsp; In all our efforts, all
our fears, all our wishes, all our sufferings, should we not
betake ourselves to Him not only as the Wise Counsellor but the
Effectual Doer?&nbsp; And in all our blessings and averted
dangers, as readily and as heartily should we offer the tribute
of thanksgiving; asking from Him what we desired, ascribing to
Him what we received throughout our life, and its every
circumstance realizing that the <span class="smcap">Lord
God</span> Omnipotent reigneth, and that we are the subjects of
His rule; in all our interests and all our duties resting and
acting upon the tremendous truth that <span
class="smcap">God</span> is a <span class="smcap">God</span> at
hand and not a <span class="smcap">God</span> afar off!</p>

RIGHT THOUGHTS OF CHRIST.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Matthew</span>, <span class="smcap">xxii</span>., 42.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;What think ye of
Christ?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> we know claimed to be the
Christ.&nbsp; He was not wont, indeed, to manifest Himself
plainly in that character to the multitude; He did not often so
speak of Himself even to the chosen; but still, indirectly, by
hint of speech and deed, He did&mdash;parabolically&mdash;propose
Himself to mankind as the promised Messiah, the Son of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the Son of David, the Saviour of the
World.&nbsp; But He was not often so received.&nbsp; A Galilean
fisherman was enabled by the Spirit to confess&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
art the Christ, the son of the Blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Samaritan
asked in wondering faith&mdash;&ldquo;Is not this the
Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; But more frequently He was regarded as
merely a prophet, as Elijah or Jeremiah, or as a wonderful man
who came from <span class="smcap">God</span>; who spake as no
other had ever spoken; who could not do such works except <span
class="smcap">God</span> were with Him.&nbsp; This was among the
well-disposed.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>His
enemies called Him &ldquo;Beelzebub, the Prince of the
Devils;&rdquo; &ldquo;The fellow that deceiveth the
people;&rdquo; &ldquo;a Nazarene;&rdquo; &ldquo;a sinner;&rdquo;
&ldquo;a winebibber;&rdquo; &ldquo;a Sabbath-breaker;&rdquo;
&ldquo;a blasphemer;&rdquo; &ldquo;guilty, <i>i.e.</i>,
deserving, of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It mattered not that they were
unable to resist the wisdom with which He spake; that He did all
things well, making both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak;
that He was proved to be versed in Divine letters, without ever
having learned (of men); that His appeals to <span
class="smcap">God</span> for vindication as a teacher of truth
and a forgiver of sins were visibly answered.&nbsp; They saw no
beauty or comeliness in Him, nor anything that should make them
desire Him; they would not come unto Him that they might have
life.&nbsp; He was despised and rejected.</p>
<p>It was when He had been exhibiting His credentials very openly
and condescendingly, and when the witnesses, with marvellous
obstinacy, had refused to believe what they saw, that drawing off
their thoughts for the moment from Himself the fulfiller of
prophecy, He bade them look back upon the prophecy itself and
answer to themselves and to Him what it was they expected:
&ldquo;What think ye,&rdquo; He demanded, &ldquo;of
Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Since you see not in me any
resemblance to <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> portrait of
His anointed One, tell me, tell yourselves what are the features
for which you look.&nbsp; I am not the being whom you
expect&mdash;what, then, do you expect? what think ye of the
Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the question was a wide one, and had they <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>been willing,
it might have perplexed them to know how to begin to answer
it.&nbsp; Therefore as though dealing with them as children, and
considerately attempting to lead them on step by step, He
immediately limits the inquiry to <i>one</i>
particular&mdash;First tell me &ldquo;whose son is
He?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ye searchers and expounders of prophecy, what
have you ascertained, what do you know of the descent of the
Messiah? whose son is He?&nbsp; They say unto
Him&mdash;&ldquo;The son of David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if any of us, my brethren, were catechising Sunday School
children, and they so answered such a question, we should commend
the answer as true though imperfect, and we should patiently and
encouragingly continue&mdash;&ldquo;True; but has He not besides
another Father? an elder and superior birth?&nbsp; Who else in
Holy Scripture is called His Father?&rdquo;&nbsp; It might be
that then some would answer&mdash;&ldquo;He is the son of
Abraham,&rdquo; or perhaps even &ldquo;the seed of the
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should bear with this, we should approve
it; we should become more hopeful of leading them to the perfect
answer, and we should therefore gently proceed&mdash;&ldquo;It is
so; but now you have traced back His earthly being to its source,
tell me whether he had not another and previous existence, and if
so from whom He derived it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way should we question children; in this way from what
we know of his forbearance and condescension do we believe that
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> would have dealt&mdash;that
indeed He did deal&mdash;with Galilean <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>fishermen or Samaritan women; but not
in this way did He deal with the Pharisees.&nbsp; He made an
objection to their answer&mdash;He seemed to reject it as
wrong.&nbsp; He asked how can that be.&nbsp; &ldquo;How then doth
David in spirit (by inspiration) call Him <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; If David call Him <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, how is He his son? and He put them to
silence, and turned away from them.&nbsp; He was not
<i>pleased</i> that they were so far orthodox as to say the
&ldquo;son of David,&rdquo; instead&mdash;as so many Jews would
erroneously have done&mdash;of &ldquo;the son of
Ephraim.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not lead on, &ldquo;What else? whose
son besides? you have but in part traced His parentage.&nbsp;
Consider, what are you taught more?&rdquo;&nbsp; No!&nbsp; He
seems to contradict them&mdash;to say, He is not David&rsquo;s
son; He is David&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;and He leaves them in apparent
perplexity.</p>
<p>Brethren, if you are in the habit of considering what you
read, this passage of Scripture must at some time have occasioned
you more or less difficulty.&nbsp; Why should Christ have
apparently repudiated His true parentage?&nbsp; Why should He
have darkened instead of enlightening these imperfect
theologians?&nbsp; It was because they had knowledge, but
perversely abused it; because they were partial in learning and
teaching the Scriptures; because they contented themselves with
low thoughts respecting Him.&nbsp; They were not uninformed
heathen: they were not tyros in the school of divinity.&nbsp;
They were <i>teachers</i> of the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;they possessed His whole Word (as
far as then <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>written), and they were familiarly acquainted with all
the contents of that Word.&nbsp; Theirs was the ignorance of men
enabled to be wise, and responsible for wisdom: it was the
corrupt misconception of what was palpable and easy to conceive
aright.&nbsp; Human pride, false tradition of their own
invention, self-interest, wilful short-sightedness, or, at the
best, culpable contentedness with low and imperfect doctrine, had
caused them to utter, perhaps to conceive, only half a truth,
when it was in their power to know the whole truth.&nbsp; It was
then in accordance with that teaching of His in
parables&mdash;dark sayings hard to understand&mdash;it was on
the principle that &ldquo;he that hath not, from him shall be
taken away even that he seemeth to have,&rdquo; that He who
hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s hard heart, and chose not Esau for not
choosing Him, now darkened the understanding of the Pharisees,
and made them blind because they would not see.</p>
<p>And His treatment of them utters a loud warning, brethren, to
us.&nbsp; The question, &ldquo;What think ye of Christ?&rdquo; is
not addressed with its full force to open heretics&mdash;to
Gnostics, in whose philosophy Christ is but one of many
&aelig;ons emanating from the hidden god of the Pleroma; to
Arians, who make Him but an inferior and created god; to
Docet&aelig;, who teach that He never was more than the shadow,
the ghost of a man; to Eutychians, who make Him a compound of
<span class="smcap">God</span> and man, partaking of both, yet
being neither; to Unitarians, who regard Him but as a perfect and
pre-eminently godlike man; to <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Universalists, who say that every
one, righteous or unrighteous, submissive or rebellious, must be
saved by Him at the last; to particular Redemptionists, who
suppose that only a chosen few, themselves that is, shall be
saved, and they without regard or care for their holiness or
iniquity&mdash;it is not, I say, to them that this question is
mainly addressed&mdash;it is to <i>us</i>; the orthodox, the
enlightened, the receivers of the whole Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the maintainers of the Three Creeds,
the theoretical believers, that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
is the Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham, the seed of
the woman, the Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the
Saviour, the Prophet, the Priest, the Vine, the Shepherd, the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the King, the Judge.&nbsp; It is
to us that the question is addressed with all its
force&mdash;with how much of its rebuke&mdash;&ldquo;What think
ye of Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christians! what think ye of Christ?&nbsp; Ask and answer this
question with all earnestness, as in the presence of Him who
first put it, Who is true, and demands the truth, and the whole
truth&mdash;and ask it, not of your minds, which it may be
supposed are ready to assent to all that Holy Scripture sets
forth respecting Him, but of your hearts, your heart of hearts,
the seat of your affections, out of which are the issues of
life&mdash;&ldquo;What think ye of Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; And stay
for a moment, pause at the threshold of the inquiry, and honestly
consider whether you think of Him at all.&nbsp; Do you ever
<i>feel</i> that there was and is such a Being?&nbsp; Do you ever
meditate on what He is, and what He has <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>done, and is
doing, and is yet to do for you?&nbsp; Do your affections twine
themselves around what they can reach of Him, and yearn for a
more perfect hold?&nbsp; Do your spiritual appetites crave food
of Him? your spiritual understandings beg for light?&nbsp; In
your sin, is He grasped as your Saviour? in your sorrow as your
Sympathiser? in your troubles as your Helper? in your comforts as
your Benefactor? in your hopes as your All? in your life, passive
and active, as your <span class="smcap">Lord</span>?&nbsp; Do you
feel any of this about Christ, or do you only think of Him as of
some historical person long since passed away, or as of some
distant lord, who knows nothing, for the time, of his
vineyard&mdash;some <i>future</i> judge, whom you need not
trouble yourselves about now, and yet whom you will not have to
fear then?&nbsp; Is it only on Sundays, at church, by your
bedside, that you think of Christ?&nbsp; Is it only as some ideal
being, some vague, distant, indifferent, easy person of the past,
the present, or the future, that you think of Him; or is He more
real and perceptible to you than the men and women around
you&mdash;more in your thoughts than any one else&mdash;more
feared than your earthly masters and rulers&mdash;more implicitly
obeyed than your most revered earthly superior&mdash;more looked
to than your most substantial earthly benefactor&mdash;more loved
than the dearest earthly object of your affections?&nbsp; Is
Christ in you the worship of your heart, the motive of your life,
the centre and summit of your hopes?&nbsp; If He stood visibly
before you now, and asked, &ldquo;Do you <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><i>think</i>
of Me;&rdquo; and if your hearts, your thoughts, your lives,
rather than your lips, had to answer, would you be able to say
honestly, &ldquo;Yea, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Thou
knowest that I do think of Thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is well, brethren, to put this preliminary question, and
try to reply to it.&nbsp; It is well to consider whether you do
think at all of Christ, before you are further asked <i>what</i>
you think of Him; because, if you are led to feel that you do
<i>not</i> think of Him, you will be ready to administer reproof
to yourselves, and that, by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace, calling you to a better
mind may spare you the rebuke of Christ; because, too, if you do
think of Him righteously, though imperfectly and partially, you
will be enabled to look up with humble hope of indulgent
consideration from Him who was the Instructor of the simple and
the unwise; and because, <i>feeling</i> your thought, you will be
anxious to enlarge, and deepen, and direct it, and so will strive
to provide yourselves with a right and full answer to the
question, <i>What</i> think ye of Christ?&nbsp; To do this fully,
is not the work of a mere half hour.&nbsp; You must take out of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word, each description,
each title of Christ; you must ask for the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
special aid in its examination; you must survey it and search it,
and survey and search yourselves, and then with earnest desire to
know Him, and to know yourselves, with long meditation and much
pains, you must find out your <i>heart&rsquo;s</i>, your
<i>life&rsquo;s</i> answer to the question, What think I of this
view, this title of Christ?&nbsp; Then, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>after
profiting by this answer, enlarging what is right, correcting
what is wrong, filling up what is wanting, you must go on to
another and another description and title, <i>keeping in mind all
the while those that have been already received</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, and thus only, will you come to <i>know</i> Christ
rightly, and so to <i>think</i> rightly of Him, advancing step by
step, growing day by day, till you reach His actual presence, and
see Him as He is, and are audibly approved by Him as of the
perfect stature and fulness of a man in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>To help you in this most profitable, spiritual exercise, let
me suggest to you how to pursue some few of its particulars.</p>
<p>What think you then of Christ as the son of Abraham, the seed
of the woman, <i>i.e.</i>, as the promised Saviour, in Whom
whosoever would was to be blessed?&nbsp; Do you really appreciate
the salvation which He has wrought out for you?&nbsp; Do you duly
consider the misery of the &ldquo;not saved?&rdquo; and are you
heartily thankful for the proffered knowledge of the saved?&nbsp;
Do you remember that He is a Saviour <i>from</i> sin, that there
is no hope whatever of deriving any benefit from His sacrifice,
so long as you willingly yield to the temptations of the devil,
or indulge the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, or the
pride of life?&nbsp; Do you therefore resolutely come out, and
become separate from sin and sinners?&nbsp; Do you further
consider how His salvation is to be laid hold on?&nbsp; Do you
avail yourselves very largely and eagerly of the means of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>salvation,
wrestling in prayer, searching the Scriptures, using diligently
all ordinances of grace?&nbsp; Is each sin carried to Him to be
effaced, and laid before Him, bedewed with the tears of
repentance?&nbsp; In every weakness and doubt do you apply to Him
(in holy communion, for instance), for strength and
guidance?&nbsp; Is it your desire, your labour, to be joined to
Him, to derive grace from Him, to grow in His image, because of
your duty, because of your interest, because, above all, of your
grateful love?&nbsp; The amount of your gratitude and devotion to
Him; of your abhorrence and renunciation of sin; of your
attendance on means of grace; of your growth in holiness; of your
joy in salvation, will furnish you with a faithful answer to the
question, &ldquo;What think ye of Christ as a Saviour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, what think ye of Christ as the son of David, the
promised <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and King who should sit
on the throne of the true Israel, and own and rule all <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> chosen people?&nbsp; Do you feel
that He is indeed your <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and
Master; that He has purchased you wholly to Himself; that you are
pledged and bound to His entire service; that every precept which
He has delivered, must be implicitly obeyed; that there must be
no doing of what He has forbidden, no omitting of what He has
commanded, no self-seeking, no mammon-worship; that all your
faculties and talents must be laid out, and all your work done
for Him; that there must be no empty profession, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo; while you do not the things
that He bids&mdash;no <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>wasting of His goods, no neglecting
of His service?&nbsp; As your <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, He
claims you wholly, body, soul, and spirit, thoughts, words, and
deeds.&nbsp; As your King, He has prescribed the service you are
to render.&nbsp; By and by, sitting on His throne, He will bring
you to account, and deal with you according to your merits.&nbsp;
What think ye of Him as your Owner, your Ruler, your Judge?</p>
<p>Again, what think ye of Christ as the son of Mary, the perfect
human being; partaking of all the properties and qualities, the
infirmities and sufferings and sympathies, the desires, the
wants, the hopes and fears of man, as far as they are separate
from sin?&nbsp; Do you contemplate His life on earth, to
ascertain what you can and ought to be, and to follow His
example?&nbsp; Are you encouraged in every aim, every resolute
resistance of evil, every patient submission to suffering, every
fulfilment of duty, every pursuit of righteousness by the thought
&ldquo;<i>Man</i> has done it, the Man Whom I am required to
imitate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do you think of Him as still retaining His
manhood with all its experience, and acquired wisdom, and
perfected obedience?&nbsp; Do you rejoice in such a Sympathizer,
such a Mediator, such a Helper, such a Judge?&nbsp; One who can
feel for you in your trials, can describe faithfully to His
Father, from His own experience, your condition and necessities,
through His knowledge can supply exactly what you need, and make
due allowance for your shortcomings and offences?</p>
<p>Once more, what think ye of Christ as the Son of <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span><span
class="smcap">God</span>? very and eternal <span
class="smcap">God</span>, with all the Divine attributes, power,
knowledge, justice, holiness, and exaction of obedience,
abhorrence of evil, wrath against sin, love of
righteousness?&nbsp; Do you feel that He is mighty to save?&nbsp;
Do you live as under His all-searching eye?&nbsp; Are you
convinced that He is impartially just, alike to approve and
disapprove, to reward and punish, in His present and future
dealings with all the partakers of His covenant?&nbsp; Do you
realise the utter impossibility of being loved by Him, of being
allowed to draw nigh to Him, of deriving any benefit from Him now
or hereafter, if you are impure, worldly, unloving,
indifferent?&nbsp; Are you impressed with the guilt of
disobedience to Him, a twice revealed, a doubly jealous <span
class="smcap">God</span>, binding you to Himself by the mercies
and responsibility of redemption, as well as creation, and by the
threats and forebodings of a particular and most righteous
judgment?&nbsp; Is it thus you think of Christ as <span
class="smcap">God</span>?</p>
<p>Dear brethren, make use, I beseech you, of these brief and
plain suggestions, to ascertain your past thoughts of Christ, to
rebuke them, if they have been low and partial, to lead you on to
perfection.&nbsp; Beware of separating what <span
class="smcap">God</span> has joined together, of recognising in
Him who is the Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>, only the
son of David.&nbsp; Never allow yourselves to joy over salvation
without remembering judgment.&nbsp; Dwell not on the Deliverer
apart from the Purchaser; appropriate not promises, if you do not
observe commands; count not on human sympathy, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>if you do not
deserve Divine compassion; expect not heavenly blessings, without
using appointed means.&nbsp; You do not think of the Christ of
the Bible, unless every phase of His character there represented,
has its due place in your thoughts.&nbsp; And so your thoughts
are unacceptable to Him, and unprofitable to you; they are
neither worship, nor helps to salvation; they do not recognise
Him at all, because they do not recognise Him altogether; they
prompt to no service, because they prompt not to all.&nbsp; An
imperfect Christ is no Christ.&nbsp; A Christian who regards Him
as imperfect, is no Christian.</p>
<p>Oh, may He who has given Christ to be our All in all, enable
us to recognise and incline us to serve, and love, and depend on
Him, as indeed our All in all!</p>

THE CHURCHMAN&rsquo;S THOUGHTS ABOUT DISSENTERS.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Luke</span>, <span class="smcap">xvii</span>., 16.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;And he was a
Samaritan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> people known as Samaritans had
their origin from certain Gentile tribes sent into the country of
Samaria early in the Babylonish captivity.&nbsp; They were of
course idolaters, and they continued to be mere idolaters, until,
being troubled with lions, which had become very numerous in
Samaria, and understanding that these were let loose among them
by the god of the country (for various countries in their creed
had various gods) to punish them for neglect of his worship, they
applied to King Shalmanezer for one of the captive priests to
teach them the Levitical law.&nbsp; Then they began to combine
with their own superstition the acknowledgment and ceremonial
service of Jehovah.&nbsp; &ldquo;They feared the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo; we read, &ldquo;and served
their own gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the return of the Jews, these Samaritans, who, it would
appear, had now relinquished much <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>of their idolatry, sought permission
to take part in the rebuilding of the temple; but being properly
rejected, they in revenge hindered and harassed the builders, and
at length, by false representations to the Syrian King, procured
a decree which suspended the continuance of the devout
work.&nbsp; This naturally made the Jews bitterly hostile to the
Samaritans: and the building of a rival temple on Mount
Gerizim&mdash;the rejection of all the inspired Books, excepting
those of Moses&mdash;the encouragement given to Jewish criminals
and outlaws to seek refuge among them, and many other
provocations, had so sustained and deepened the feeling against
them, that, in our <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> time,
the Jews would have no dealings with the Samaritans; and in any
want or danger, would much rather have suffered death, than
receive succour at their hands.</p>
<p>Thus were the Samaritans despised and shunned; and that there
was at least some measure of justice in their treatment, we may
safely infer from our <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>
rebuke of them&mdash;&ldquo;Ye worship ye know not what;&rdquo;
and from His charge to the apostles, &ldquo;Into any city of the
Samaritans enter ye not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their creed was heretical,
their worship schismatic.&nbsp; They belonged not to the
covenanted people of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And
yet the <i>only one</i> out of ten miraculously healed lepers,
who discharged the religious obligation of rendering thanks and
glorifying <span class="smcap">God</span>, and who received
spiritual benefit from Christ, was a <i>Samaritan</i>.&nbsp; The
model neighbour to the man who had fallen among thieves, was a
<i>Samaritan</i>.&nbsp; They <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>were Samaritans who so early and so
openly professed, &ldquo;We have heard Him ourselves, and know
that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the Jews persecuted the disciples,
and thrust them out of Jerusalem, Samaria readily and largely
received the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span> at their
mouths.&nbsp; Thankful and acceptable adoration of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, exemplary brotherly love, enlightened
faith, prompt renunciation of error, and acceptance of
truth&mdash;these were graces which shone conspicuously in
heretical and schismatic Samaritans, and won for them from the
Saviour of Israel approbation, and love, and blessing.</p>
<p>Remarkable as these things are in themselves, they become much
more so by contrast with the several cases of the Jews mentioned
in their respective contexts.&nbsp; Thus nine <i>Jewish</i>
lepers were unthankful; a priest and a Levite passed by on the
other side; the Prophet returning from Samaria, where He had been
confessed, was not respected in His own country; Jerusalem had
but lately rejected the Word which Samaria received.&nbsp; How
was this?&nbsp; How came heterodoxy to be productive of
acceptable fruit, while orthodoxy in the same circumstances was
barren and unfruitful?&nbsp; The pursuit of this inquiry would
doubtless be very interesting, but it would necessarily occupy
much time, and lead us into the regions of speculation.&nbsp; I
prefer, therefore, just now, to deal with the history of our text
as a <i>fact</i>, and to endeavour to deduce from that fact three
or four plain and profitable <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>lessons.&nbsp; Nine professors of the
true religion, members of the covenanted people of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, to whom pertained all the privileges,
and gifts, and evidences, and responsibilities of a manifested
Divine rule, were undutiful and unblessed in the very
circumstances in which a stranger, an alien, belonging to a sect
unsound in doctrine, and schismatic in practice,
<i>volunteered</i> to <span class="smcap">God</span> most
acceptable service, and received from Him the highest spiritual
benediction.</p>
<p>Now, what does this teach us&mdash;us, the members of the
Church of England?&nbsp; First, with respect to ourselves, it
teaches us not to pride ourselves in, or to rest satisfied with,
a mere profession of the true faith.&nbsp; There is indeed but
one true faith&mdash;that, namely, which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has delivered to us in His Word, and
maintained by the testimony of His Church.&nbsp; To accept this
faith in its integrity, is to set one&rsquo;s seal to the
testimony that <span class="smcap">God</span> is true; to reject
deliberately one article of it, no matter how small, how
apparently unimportant, is to make <span class="smcap">God</span>
a liar, inasmuch as it is to refuse as false what He has offered
us as true.&nbsp; Common <i>duty</i> then, and ordinary fear lest
we should become blasphemers, render it imperative that we should
most anxiously inquire what is the true faith, and then most
implicitly receive its every article.&nbsp; We <i>may not
choose</i> (heresy means choice) what we will believe, and what
reject.&nbsp; To alter, or accept less than what <span
class="smcap">God</span> has propounded, is to act in defiance of
Him, and to cast a slur upon His infallible <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>truth.&nbsp;
Is it reason to suppose that we can do this with impunity?&nbsp;
Besides, remember, what <span class="smcap">God</span> reveals to
us as articles of faith, are no mere abstract truths for the
philosopher to muse upon, and no more.&nbsp; They are the
impelling force, the germ and embodiment of principles and ways
of life, on the observance of which our very salvation
depends.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to
eat?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whosoever says, &ldquo;I do not <i>choose</i>
to believe that He can in any way,&rdquo; does not, as he
imagines, merely deny a subtle dogma, he gives up a vital
principle of godliness, without which of course he will not seek
to eat Christ&rsquo;s flesh; and so, if Christ be true, can have
no spiritual life in Him.</p>
<p>For these two reasons, then&mdash;because they are revealed by
<span class="smcap">God</span> as verities, and because they are
the foundations of godliness&mdash;it is essentially important to
receive every article of the faith: and we, who find ourselves
members of a communion in which the faith is thus received, which
is apostolic in doctrine, and primitive in practice, have
therefore much indeed to be thankful for, and may harmlessly, so
as it be humbly, rejoice in the possession of such great
privileges.&nbsp; But let us not be high-minded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he
fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jews were a highly privileged people; they
received the whole inspired Word; their priests were all called
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, as was Aaron; they worshipped
in the appointed place, and observed all the enjoined times and
ceremonies; yet with many of them <span class="smcap">God</span>
was not well pleased.&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>They were unreal, hollow, formal,
hypocritical; their service was listless and unmeaning; and so,
notwithstanding all their privileges and all their orthodoxy, a
Samaritan, a dog of the Gentiles, a publican, a harlot was often
nearer to the kingdom of heaven than they were, and met Christ,
when they missed Him.</p>
<p>Is not this a warning to us?&nbsp; What though we possess the
pure and entire faith, though we have an appointed ministry, and
continue in the apostles&rsquo; fellowship, though the spirit of
Christ be present in our ordinances, and all our forms and
ceremonies be after an approved pattern, yet may we not any of us
be unreal in our use of these things, hollow, formal, listless,
and so go away unaccepted and unblessed, while the less
privileged Romanist or Dissenter is receiving the sweet
assurance, &ldquo;Thy faith hath made thee whole?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Depend upon it this may be, and often is the case.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> would have us <i>intellectually</i>
wise, but He would also have us <i>heartily</i> good.&nbsp; A
good heart and a right mind <i>united</i>, form the being who is
most blessed; with whom the covenant is surest, and in whom <span
class="smcap">God</span> takes most delight; but better, far
better, a good heart alone, than a right mind alone.</p>
<p>Christ, as He walked on earth the messenger of peace and love
to all men, had a special interest in the Jews (His own people),
but it was in Jews whose practice corresponded with their
profession, whose heart and life illustrated what their
understanding received.&nbsp; On such as these, His highest <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>favours would
have been most readily bestowed; but wanting these qualities, He
estimated their orthodoxy at nothing; and, on the other hand,
finding these qualities among strangers and aliens, He allowed
not their heterodoxy to prove an obstacle to their
blessing.&nbsp; In many cases uncircumcision was counted for
circumcision, and circumcision for uncircumcision.</p>
<p>My dear brethren, value ordinances greatly, but rest not, I
charge you, in them.&nbsp; Boast not that you are
Anglo-Catholics; that your ministers have an Apostolic
succession; that you were regenerated in baptism; that you are
regular communicants and worshippers at the daily service.&nbsp;
These are, indeed, great privileges; but connected with them are
great responsibilities.&nbsp; Is your pure faith illustrated by a
pure life?&nbsp; Do you make the best use of an Apostolic
ministry?&nbsp; Are you growing in the spirit of which you were
born again?&nbsp; Do you feel and sustain the communicated
presence of Christ within you?&nbsp; When you go down from the
sanctuary, does your life shine, as Moses&rsquo;s face did, with
the reflected glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; If
not, talk not of your high privileges&mdash;your case would be
better without them.&nbsp; When <span class="smcap">God</span>
ceased to wink at the errors and ungodliness of mankind, He began
by punishing, and with much severity, the errors and ungodliness
of the privileged Jews.&nbsp; Yes, and whenever He takes account,
and passes judgment, it is on the principle that to whom much has
been given, of him shall much be required.&nbsp; &ldquo;You only
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>have I
known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish
you for all your iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To him that
knoweth, to do good and doeth it not, to him it is
sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second thought which the fact of our text suggests, is one
of great comfort to the benevolent heart.&nbsp; It is, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> will make a way through a bad system, to
the disciple of that system who has been trying to reach
Him.&nbsp; When one reflects on the grave and blinding errors of
modern Romanism; on the awful denial of our blessed <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> Divinity by the Unitarians; on
the capricious choice, what to believe, what to deny, which each
Protestant sect ventures to make and maintain; on the disuse of a
ministry, the ignoring of sacraments, and other holy ordinances
by the Society of Friends, what a comfort is there in our text,
&ldquo;And he was a Samaritan;&rdquo; in feeling that <span
class="smcap">God</span> condescends to get through all this, to
the yearning, would-be faithful heart; ay, that He even accepts
the purblind visions and stammering utterances of such an one as
<i>faith</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy faith hath made thee
whole&rdquo;!&nbsp; Most of us know some members of such sects
with whom we should wish to dwell together in heaven, for whom
our heart is rejoiced to feel that there are such prospects, in
whose sanctified lives we have the present proof, that (however
<i>originators</i> of heresy and schism may be regarded) in every
nation and every sect, he that heareth <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and worketh righteousness, is accepted
with Him.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>But,
thirdly, are we therefore to make no difference between orthodoxy
and heterodoxy?&nbsp; Are we to be indifferent to truth and
error?&nbsp; Are we to frequent Romish chapels or Dissenting
conventicles with as little compunction as though they were our
proper sanctuaries?&nbsp; Are we to promote the schemes of other
communions, by contributing to them out of our substance, or by
lending our names or presence to them?&nbsp; No, brethren, we are
not to confound Jew and Samaritan, nor to regard the schismatic
building on Gerizim, as equally an approved sanctuary with the
temple at Jerusalem.&nbsp; We are not to gather professors of
different sects together; by concessions and suppressions to
produce an outward conforming, and then to proclaim, &ldquo;This
is what Christians should be.&nbsp; This is an Evangelical
alliance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evangelical alliance! alliance,
<i>i.e.</i>, according to the Gospel!&nbsp; Christ, indeed,
willed us to be one; but it was by all receiving the whole truth,
not by paring and cropping it each one as he will, and then
calling the hacked and deformed thing of our own shaping His
glorious Gospel.&nbsp; Judge for yourselves:&mdash;one man
believes that the Blessed Virgin and other saints are his
mediators with <span class="smcap">God</span>; another, that
Christ alone is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, but that Christ
must be sought in His own appointed sacraments, or not found at
all; a third completely ignores all sacraments.&nbsp; Shall these
three stand side by side, and say, &ldquo;We are allied according
to the Gospel&mdash;we all believe alike&rdquo;?&nbsp; Surely
such a thing is a mockery of <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>common sense, and an act of treason
against their respective communions.</p>
<p>Yes, and it is worse.&nbsp; For, first of all, as I have
already said, there is but one faith propounded in Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; Men may differ in their perception of that
faith&mdash;the Romanist regards it in one light, the Anglican in
another, the &ldquo;Friend&rdquo; in a third.&nbsp; But each of
these believes himself to be right, and he <i>must therefore</i>
regard the others as wrong.&nbsp; Now, if they are wrong, then by
slurring over their error, he makes it his own; he joins in the
choosing of a creed other than that <span
class="smcap">God</span> has framed, and so insults the
Infallible Truth.&nbsp; Again, there are no sins more strictly
forbidden, more severely denounced in the Bible than those of
heresy, <i>choosing</i> what to believe, instead of adopting the
Apostolic faith, without increase or diminution, and schism,
separating oneself, that is, without most strong reason from
worship in appointed places, conducted by appointed officers,
according to the prescribed form.&nbsp; These sins are classed by
St. Paul with the grossest works of the flesh, and it is said of
those that cause them, that they shall not inherit the kingdom of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>It is evident, then, that patronising or encouraging in any
way a religious community from which we personally honestly
differ, is disobeying a positive command of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and incurring awful risk of His
displeasure.&nbsp; And there is another argument against seeming
recognition of heresy or schism: namely, that we thereby often
cause the weak brother <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>to offend, and hinder the anxious
inquirer after truth from renouncing error.&nbsp; If those who
look up to us for guidance&mdash;and there are very few of us but
are accepted as guides by some&mdash;see us <i>once</i> among the
Samaritans, they will take license and encouragement from us to
be there <i>frequently</i>; and so, if those who are in doubt
between remaining aloof from the Church and joining it, see
Churchmen in their assemblies, they will assuredly gather that
there is no difference of importance between them and us, and
will remain where they are.&nbsp; For all these reasons, it is of
the utmost importance that the Churchman, while entertaining the
most benevolent feelings towards those who differ from him, while
gratefully acknowledging the good they do, while inwardly
rejoicing that wandering sinners should be proselytised by them,
and have a faith of some kind rather than none at all; while,
too, hoping and praying that our blessed <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> prayer may yet be realised, and
that all who call upon His name may ultimately be of one heart
and one mind, and with one mouth glorify <span
class="smcap">God</span>; should still most strictly abstain in
presence, in deed, in speech, and in look, from the remotest
encouragement, or sanction of erroneous doctrine, or religious
disunion and division.&nbsp; Meet these men in business you often
must; meet them in friendship, in secular consultation, in
practical benevolence, you may; but meet them in their religious
capacity, frequent their places of worship, forward the objects
of their sect you must not, unless you are prepared <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to go over to
them altogether; to maintain that theirs is <i>the</i> faith, and
<i>the</i> fellowship; and that all not in communion with them
are heretics or schismatics.&nbsp; Give no uncertain sound.&nbsp;
Halt not between two opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that is not with
Me is against Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more lesson to guard against misinterpretation of the
last.&nbsp; I have used some strong words in speaking of those
that differ.&nbsp; Do not, pray, suppose that I would have you
regard them with any but kind feelings, much less that I would
teach you to cry out against their errors, in railing or
contemptuous tones.&nbsp; The Christian minister intent upon
laying down clearly the line of right thought and practice, has
occasion to speak plainly, and for his hearers&rsquo; sake to
call things by their right names, however grating they may sound;
but with the private individual it is otherwise.&nbsp; In his
ordinary course, he has no need to speak of these things, or to
think of them, further than to prompt his earnest prayers for the
decay of error and dissension, and the establishment of truth and
union.&nbsp; And if at any time it becomes his duty or desire to
stay a soul from error, or to convert him from it, let him
remember, and be sure it is true, that one ounce of love will do
more good than many pounds of controversy. <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>Loud cries of &ldquo;No popery,&rdquo; invectives against High
Church or Low Church, sneers against &ldquo;cant,&rdquo;
imputations of unworthy motives to those <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>who differ,
contemptuous pity of their ignorance or inferiority, are all
carnal.&nbsp; They will unspiritualise yourselves; they will
retard, rather than advance the good work on others; they will
drive away from you the only power in which you can hope to
prevail, that of the Spirit of holiness, and love, and peace.</p>
<p>While then as Churchmen, it is your bounden duty to regard
other systems of religion as inferior, perhaps erroneous; be sure
that in dealing with the individual disciples of those systems,
you remember the history of the thankful Samaritan, and consider
that like him, they may be approved and sanctified followers of
your common <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>Resolve to put away all animosity, and strife, and
captiousness; to take the best rather than the worst view of what
you dislike, or do not understand; in short, while maintaining as
far as possible the orthodoxy of Him who was a true Israelite;
like Him, and for His sake, endeavour to love men for themselves,
if you cannot love their system; and to rejoice in the
opportunity of treating the Samaritan as a brother, and of
bringing him within nearer reach of abiding blessedness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> read in the third chapter of
Genesis of the introduction of death into our world&mdash;how sin
alienated <span class="smcap">God</span> from man and man from
<span class="smcap">God</span>, how those who had been endowed
with the best faculties of enjoying bliss, who were surrounded by
all desirable blessings, who dwelt beneath the bright sun of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> favour, were by an act of
unbelief and wilfulness, suggested by the evil one, driven
angrily into the outer world, where toil, and pain, and manifold
misery were thenceforth to be their lot.</p>
<p>We are sometimes tempted to think, that the actual punishment
of our first parents was less than that they had been threatened
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die,&rdquo; was <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
assurance; but when they ate they did not die,&mdash;as we
account dying; they were but banished from the Garden of Eden,
and prevented from returning, by cherubims who kept the entrance,
and a flaming sword which turned <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>every way.&nbsp; It was indeed a sad
reverse&mdash;a wilderness instead of a garden&mdash;sorrow
instead of joy&mdash;toil instead of rest&mdash;curses instead of
blessings: but it was not the threatened death.&nbsp; They did
not die.</p>
<p>So we are wont to think: but we err therein; they did die,
brethren.&nbsp; This reverse <i>was</i> death.&nbsp; Death (what
<span class="smcap">God</span> means by death) is not
annihilation&mdash;not ceasing to be; it is protracted existence
apart from <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the blessings of
His right hand, and the light of His countenance.&nbsp; More
truly did they die when they entered upon this state of
existence, than when, hundreds of years afterwards, their bodies
stiffened, and their breath ceased, and their flesh turned to
corruption in the grave.&nbsp; It is a misconception&mdash;a
practical unbelief of immortality, which makes us think
otherwise.&nbsp; The soul does not perish&mdash;does not slumber;
living once, it lives ever, and ever knows and feels its
existence.&nbsp; The separation of it from the body alters its
circumstances, uncasing it&mdash;depriving it of one of its
appendages&mdash;breaking off its connexion with a material and
natural world; but not destroying it.&nbsp; No; it lives on, and
lives on (in its spiritual relations) as it did before, save that
the withdrawal of bodily senses enables and <i>obliges</i> the
spiritual senses to exercise themselves to the full, and so
intensifies the feelings, and completes the realisation of the
spiritual state.</p>
<p>Suppose that in the moment that Adam was driven out of
Paradise, he had actually died, that his soul had been
immediately separated from the <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>body; what would have been the state
of that soul?&nbsp; The same, really, as it was while he
lived&mdash;banishment from the presence of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, with the consequent absence of what was
desirable, and presence of what was hateful.&nbsp; He would have
<i>felt</i> it more.&nbsp; Having nothing else to gaze on, the
blankness of the spiritual world around him, save where evil
spirits stood revealed, would have been more terrible.&nbsp; The
desires would have been more intolerable when there was nothing
to divert attention from them, and the constrained employments
more distasteful.&nbsp; Hopelessness, too, of remedy in that
fixed state, which is to have no change but that of increase
throughout eternity, would have caused his death to <i>appear</i>
a greater reality, but it would not have <i>made</i> it a greater
reality.&nbsp; The continuance of bodily existence palliated
death; a natural world spread before his eyes diverted his gaze
from the spiritual &ldquo;void&rdquo;; natural pain even, and
sorrow, and toil, beguiled his thoughts and feelings, in a
measure, from spiritual miseries; but still he <i>was</i> dead,
though he knew it not fully.&nbsp; His state was like to that of
the child who sleeps calmly in the dark; but when it wakes, cries
and starts in terror.&nbsp; There was darkness all along; but
only when the eyes were opened was it fully
perceived&mdash;<i>felt</i>.</p>
<p>Now, natural death is like this <i>waking</i>; it does not so
much transfer us to another state, as show us clearly in what
state we are; whether in the presence of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, or banished from Him.&nbsp; To be in
outer darkness, where hope never comes, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>where the sun
of heaven sends forth no rays; to be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and from the glory of His power, this
is death <i>completed</i>.&nbsp; Surely, then, to be without
<span class="smcap">God</span> in the world; to be removed from
His favouring, and comforting, and guiding presence; to live only
in such unconscious dependence on Him as the beasts that perish;
to have but the good things of our own finding; this is death
<i>begun</i>: this is to have a name to live, and yet be dead, to
be as really dead as are the spirits of the doomed-departed,
except that we know not fully (which is part of death) the misery
of our condition; and (blessed be <span
class="smcap">God</span>!) that we may as yet live again, and be
restored to His presence, because Christ has opened the gates of
Paradise, and bids His angels gently drive us in, if we will;
yea, calls to us Himself, and entreats us to enter; to have again
the condition&mdash;spiritualised, exalted, perfected&mdash;of
unfallen Adam.</p>
<p>My brethren, thus think of death, and of life.&nbsp; Do not
make so much of the heaving of the last sigh; the drawing of the
last breath; as though the battle of life were fought, and the
victory achieved on a death-bed; as though the soul began its
banishment when it quits the body.&nbsp; Many, whose flesh has
long since mouldered into dust, have never really died; and many,
who still walk the earth, full of energy, and vigour, and what
man calls life, are really dead.&nbsp; To live, is to be with
<span class="smcap">God</span>: to live for ever, is to be with
<span class="smcap">God</span> for <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>ever.&nbsp; To die, is to be without
<span class="smcap">God</span>: to die for ever, is to be without
<span class="smcap">God</span> for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
says Christ, &ldquo;a man keep my sayings, he shall never see
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever liveth and believeth on me,
shall never die.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath the Son hath
life, and he that hath not the Son of <span
class="smcap">God</span> hath not life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have said thus much to suggest to your consideration a very
important, life-directing truth, viz.: that the heavenly life and
the second death, both have their beginning on this side the
grave; that <span class="smcap">God</span>, for Christ&rsquo;s
sake, vouchsafes His presence, to those who seek and honour it,
to guide, and comfort, and strengthen, and sanctify them; and
where He is there is real life: on the other hand, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> withdraws Himself from those who
disregard, or slight Him; and where He is not, there is death,
the second death&mdash;capable, as yet, of being overcome, and
put to an end; but more likely to prevail permanently in
proportion as it is not felt; and even now working many of its
miserable effects on all, not excepting the most hardened and
apathetic who are subject to it.&nbsp; Try, dear brethren, to
impress yourselves with this truth.&nbsp; Do not merely
<i>hope</i> for eternal life, or <i>fear</i> the second death
<i>beyond the grave</i>, <i>after you die</i>.&nbsp; Try to
secure the one (the actual possession of it, I mean), and to
avoid the other, in <i>this</i> life, by earnestly seeking and
sustaining the real, the proffered presence with you, and in you,
of the life-giving and upholding <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>But,
there is a better presence, a more perfect life, spoken of in the
text.&nbsp; To this I would refer, as furnishing truest
consolation, exciting liveliest hopes, and stimulating to holiest
exertions,&mdash;&ldquo;eternal abode with <span
class="smcap">God</span> in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
minister of Christ would comfort the mourning relatives of a
departed saint, and, as the phrase is, improve the occasion to
their good, he does not forbid them to feel and express sorrow,
for he remembers that Christ wept at the tomb of Lazarus, but
only charges them to set bounds to their sorrow, and prepare to
stay it presently; because, it is merely a <i>natural</i>, and
not a <i>Christian</i> feeling; because, if continued, it becomes
a selfish, inconsiderate bemoaning of their personal loss; a
virtual denial that the departed is at rest, and in bliss; a
rejection of the hope that they shall meet again, in a better and
abiding home.&nbsp; &ldquo;So shall we ever be with the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; What mean these
words?&nbsp; We know in theory (many of us, let me hope,
experimentally), what it is to be with <span
class="smcap">God</span>, or to have Him with us
<i>here</i>.&nbsp; It is not simply to dwell in the same world
with Him, near Him, close to Him, by His permission, under His
observance and government, as the omnipresent <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; No! it is not the
<i>necessary</i>, but a <i>special</i> presence which we
mean.&nbsp; A presence like that which accompanied the Israelites
through the wilderness; which actually went with them, guided
them, fed them, helped them in difficulties, reproved them in
transgressions, interested Itself specially in their
circumstances, <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>and manifested that interest, not only by its doings,
but by a sight of Itself in a pillar of fire, or a pillar of a
cloud.</p>
<p>Again, like that presence, it is not constant; the pillar is
sometimes withdrawn.&nbsp; There is, occasionally, no answer
given by Urim and Thummim; we are left to fight, now and then, in
our own strength only, and then we fail; we hunger, we thirst,
and no Divine supply comes; we mourn, and there is no spiritual
comfort; we murmur, and there is no reproof; we sin, and there is
no chastisement: <span class="smcap">God</span>, for the time, is
absent from our camp.</p>
<p>Again, like that presence, it does not secure us from
trials.&nbsp; We have long marches, and powerful adversaries; we
journey on in perils in the wilderness, in perils of waters, in
perils of robbers, in perils of our own countrymen (our fellow
Christians), in perils by the heathen; in weariness and
painfulness; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in
fastings often; in cold and nakedness; in deaths oft.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, peradventure, is with us all the while;
but it is through the world of tribulation He leads us, not by a
miraculously smooth and safe path.&nbsp; His presence is
manifested in occasional glimpses.&nbsp; His voice is heard in
disjoined words.&nbsp; His arm is felt in intermittent
upholdings.&nbsp; I cannot well picture this presence to those
who have no experience of it; I need not do so to those who have
realised it: but all may see that, in this lower world, we are
not ever with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the fullest
manifestation of His presence; in the constant <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>upholding of
His arm; in entire exemption from trials; in perfect fruition of
blessings.&nbsp; That may not be on earth.&nbsp; The sun may
lighten up our dark hovel; but it is a hovel still.&nbsp; Divine
help may lessen our labour; but we must labour still.&nbsp;
Divine consolation may soothe us in our losses; but we are to
suffer losses still.&nbsp; Howsoever <span
class="smcap">God</span> be with us; whatsoever He does for us;
the wilderness is still a wilderness.</p>
<p>But the wilderness has a limit; its limit is what we call
death.&nbsp; To the faithful, that bourne is like the
Jordan,&mdash;when they have crossed it, they shall be in the
promised land, the land that floweth with milk and honey, where
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> abiding, glorious temple
is set up; wherein there remaineth rest and joy for the people of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Whoso entereth that land,
shall be ever with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, enjoying
His most complete and satisfying presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father, I
will that those whom thou hast given me may be with me where I
am, that they may behold my glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prayer shall
then be realised.&nbsp; They shall see the King in His beauty,
and the land that is now afar off.&nbsp; There shall be no more
curse; but the throne of <span class="smcap">God</span> and of
the Lamb shall be in their dwelling: they shall serve Him, and
they shall see His face: with what feelings and emotions, at
present we can form no adequate conceptions; but we know that it
shall be with joy: that they shall love and praise Him; that it
shall be their untiring, unalloyed delight to <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>gaze upon His
glory, to sing His praises, to share His love.</p>
<p>And they shall be like Him.&nbsp; As, in this world, they have
borne the image of the earthly Adam, so, in that, they shall bear
the image of the heavenly.&nbsp; That image, lost in the fall,
must indeed begin to be resumed here in regeneration, and be more
and more put on in life-long conversion to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; By contemplating Christ, and
watching His countenance, as we are allowed to see it here, we
must gradually assume His features, and be changed into His
image.&nbsp; But we must see Him, not in faint resemblances, and
bare outline, but as He is, before we can be wholly like
Him.&nbsp; Then, but not before, shall we be transfigured, and
glorified, and changed from glory to glory; body and spirit
advancing in excellence, and intelligence, and love, and bliss,
till they become what and as Christ is,&mdash;reaching unto the
full stature of a man in Christ <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
satisfied with the perfect assumption of His likeness.</p>
<p>Yes, and as they gaze ever on Him, so shall He on them.&nbsp;
No sin shall cause the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to hide
His face from them; no discipline shall require His occasional
withdrawal; no cloud shall obscure heaven&rsquo;s sky; no frown
shall be seen; no reproof heard.&nbsp; <i>He</i> shall not try
them.&nbsp; <i>Evil</i> shall not approach to tempt them.&nbsp; A
Saviour&rsquo;s love shall surround them; not to carry them
through a wilderness, not to keep them in tribulations, but to
lead them beside the clear fountains of peace; to <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>plant them
all around His throne, where with eyes wiped of all tears, they
shall feast on His presence, and, with adoring souls and bodies,
rest in His love.</p>
<p>And shall not the sharing of this presence with others augment
their bliss?&nbsp; <i>We</i> (they and us) shall be ever with the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; All the sons of <span
class="smcap">God</span> shall there meet together, and dwell
with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; Man, I need not
tell you, is a social being: he is formed for company; he cannot
be fully happy alone.&nbsp; It is by sharing his good things that
he comes to enjoy them; it is by speaking of them, that he comes
to feel them.&nbsp; (Would that Christians could be brought to
act on this admitted truth, as Christians!)&nbsp; In this world
there is no greater enjoyment than to associate with a band of
fellow-countrymen, journeying towards the same place, with
kindred tastes, and tempers, and hopes.&nbsp; Oh! what then shall
be the blessedness of association in heaven with the whole body
of the saints?&nbsp; Think of being associated in the presence,
and favour, and adoration of <span class="smcap">God</span>, with
holy angels; with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; with David, and
Daniel, and Mary, and John, and Paul; and all the others whose
praise is in the Gospel!&nbsp; Think of meeting, in heaven, with
all the primitive Christians and martyrs; with all the perfected
saints who once walked on earth with us; with our relatives, our
parents, our brothers and sisters, our children, our bosom
friends: to be re-united with them in bonds that <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>shall never
be broken; where all are happy; where every eye looks to <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>, where every heart leaps to Him; each
mouth is opened in His praise; each knee is bent in His
adoration; where <span class="smcap">God</span> is the centre and
the circumference, and heaven the roof and the floor!&nbsp; And
all this for ever&mdash;uninterrupted, unending, growing fresher,
intensified, better appreciated by the rolling on of
eternity.&nbsp; <i>So</i> shall we ever be with the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>Bereaved Christian, as you gaze upon the vacant place of one
who is in Paradise, advancing to this heaven, will you dare to
sigh that the old armchair, or the little cradle, is
unoccupied?&nbsp; Would you prefer for your loved one, as a
<i>better</i> condition, that he or she should come back and
share your sorrows, and difficulties, and perplexities, and be
exposed to toil and contamination?&nbsp; Will your ingratitude
think lightly of what <span class="smcap">God</span> has done,
and is doing, for the removed one?&nbsp; Will your selfishness
(oh, if the dead should know of this!) demand&mdash;&ldquo;Let me
have my loved one&rsquo;s company, though thereby that loved one
lose <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh!
there is no religion, there is no human love, in the mourner who
does not smile away the tears of worldly sorrow with the joy of
this blessed consolation; who does not turn each thought of the
righteous dead into a theme of praise for their deliverance; into
a prayer, that he, too, may soon be added to the number of those
who are ever with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!</p>
<p>Christian pilgrim, journeying through the wilderness, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>footsore,
beleaguered, stumbling, smitten, losing sight ever and anon of
the guiding pillar, wandering out of the path, too often
unsustained, uncomforted, do you <i>fear</i> death?&nbsp; Do you
shudder at and flee from the sight of the Jordan through which
angels wait to guide you; whose other bank is in heaven?&nbsp;
Oh! how little do you think of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> abiding presence!&nbsp; What a
mere name is your love of Christ!&nbsp; How unreal was your
professed affection for those who have gone before!&nbsp; How
foolishly blind are you to your own best interests!&nbsp; What a
sham is your so-called pilgrimage, your journey to a shrine which
you fear to reach!&nbsp; What shall I say to those who wilfully
linger in the wilderness, while the host passes on, and the
night, with all its howling terrors, is at hand; to those who
would turn back, and would cross again the Red Sea into Egypt,
while the waves are prepared to overwhelm the Egyptians&mdash;in
plain terms, to those who live not in <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> presence here, and seek not to
have it hereafter?&nbsp; Shall I describe to you the positive
horrors of hell; its gnawing worms, its devouring flames, its
malignant frenzied spirits?&nbsp; No; I will but warn you, that
you are fast approaching an outer darkness, where there is no
enjoyment, no hope, no heaven, no Saviour, no <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Ye shall be for ever without the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>Brethren, one and all, what shall we do to inherit the
glorious, abiding presence of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Oh! let us make much of the
partial presence which is <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>now within our reach.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Abide in me, and I in you,&rdquo; says Christ.&nbsp; Let
us live near to Him; let us live much in Him; let us live as He
tells us.&nbsp; Contemplate we Him in His holy Word; pore over it
day after day, till we see Him as in a glass; till His glory is
reflected on us, and we shine with the glorious light.&nbsp;
Watch we for Him in all our ways, listen for His voice, lean on
His arm, fight in His strength.&nbsp; Feed we our desires with
heavenly food; not the quails of our own lust, but the manna from
heaven, and the water out of the rock; the bread and wine, which
are meat indeed and drink indeed.&nbsp; Having this
hope&mdash;desiring, that is, to be ever with Him&mdash;let us
purify ourselves, even as He is pure, and study day by day to
conform ourselves more and more to His pattern.</p>
<p>Yes; believe in heaven, desire heaven, live for heaven.&nbsp;
As St. Peter says, &ldquo;Add to your faith, virtue; and to
virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to
temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to
godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness,
charity.&nbsp; For if these things be in you and abound, they
make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>;
and so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly, into
the everlasting kingdom of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
and Saviour <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>SERMON
V.<br />
MAN&rsquo;S KNOWLEDGE LIMITED.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I. <span
class="smcap">Cor</span>., <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.,
9</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;We know in part.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one sense, the words of our text
have been ever true, and ever shall be.&nbsp; Even in the Garden
of Eden, when man possessed knowledge of such a kind, and to such
a degree, as to be a feature of the moral likeness of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, there were still many things which he
could not grasp, nor fathom, nor measure, and there were many
others which the Divine will purposely kept unrevealed from
him.&nbsp; And so too, hereafter, in heaven itself, the perfected
finite being must necessarily fail to comprehend and scrutinize
thoroughly the great infinite, and doubtless will be left
uninformed of much that he could grasp, because the knowledge
thereof will not concern his duty or his interest.</p>
<p>But, in another sense, man did once know, and shall again
know, perfectly.&nbsp; In his unfallen state, <span
class="smcap">God</span> talked to him plainly, made His presence
to be realised, in a way showed Himself as He is, that is, as He
is in His relation to obedient and holy man, taught clearly the
duty, and revealed the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>destiny and hopes of His
creature.&nbsp; And, again, in heaven, though still dwelling in
light which no one can approach to, though still the Invisible,
Whom no man hath seen or can see, <span class="smcap">God</span>
shall yet be plainly reflected in His Son, the visible Deity with
Whom the redeemed shall stand face to face, Whom they shall see
and know even as now they are known by Him.&nbsp; And man, too,
though still not omniscient, shall know thoroughly with whom he
has to do; shall trace with easy clearness the path along which
he has been led; shall realise his position and appropriate his
privileges, and see even to the utmost his eternal future.&nbsp;
This has been already, in a measure.&nbsp; This shall be
hereafter entirely; but this is not now.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know in
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When man sinned, the lamp of knowledge grew dim, and well nigh
went out.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> put a thick cloud
between Him and His creature, and between that creature and the
future; and around him and above him, for light He gave
obscurity.&nbsp; But yet straightway of His compassion and love
in Christ, He began to give back as with a slow hand, what He had
suddenly withdrawn with a swift hand.&nbsp; A tiny spark was
kindled, which was very gradually to be fanned into a little
flame, and finally to burst out into a blaze, which should make
all visible again.&nbsp; Yea, and <i>more</i> visible than at the
first.&nbsp; You know how the grace of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;which made man at the first
innocent, upright, and happy, with great power of understanding
and free will&mdash;having been forfeited, was withdrawn, but yet
began at <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>once to be recommunicated&mdash;not immediately in its
former perfection, but by little and little, and at slow paces;
first, externally by the Spirit in the world; then, internally,
by the Spirit of regeneration planted as a seed in each
Christian&rsquo;s heart, to be gradually developed into the
blade, the ear, and, finally, the ripe corn in the ear, at the
resurrection, the restoration to the full favour and realised
presence of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>This may explain to you how knowledge was reimparted.&nbsp; At
first it was but a spark for the whole world; then it became a
tiny flame, by which those near at hand might dimly see.&nbsp;
Then a spark from it was struck into each Christian mind, which
may be, and is to be gradually fanned up in him, revealing more
and more what is in him, and about him, and before him, till in
heaven it bursts out into a full flame, showing all things
clearly.&nbsp; Into each of us this spark has been struck; in
each of us it is to be fostered, and fed, and developed; to
exhibit more and more what <span class="smcap">God</span> is, and
does; what we are, and have, and hope for, till we come unto
perfect knowledge, and see all clearly.&nbsp; Men of the
patriarchal age had but the one spark among them.&nbsp; The Jews
had this spark become a little flame; and some of them, as David,
Solomon, and Daniel, had each a torch lighted from it, and held
near at hand to them, as by a guardian angel.&nbsp; We
Christians, I say, have each <i>in us</i> a spark kindled.&nbsp;
If we feed and fan it, it becomes a flame; and according as we
feed and fan it, grows <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>brighter and larger, and extends
nearer and nearer to that point, where it shall unite with
others, and light up heaven with an eternal blaze.&nbsp;
<i>Thus</i> do we know, all of us in part, but not all equally,
some less, some more, according to our measure, and according as
we guard and tend it, and all imperfectly, because the time and
place of perfection are not yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know in part.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, one of the most
important thoughts which this text suggests is, that we
Christians all have to some extent the privilege of spiritual
knowledge, and consequently, we all have resting upon us, the
responsibility of maintaining and increasing knowledge.&nbsp; You
all, brethren, know in part.&nbsp; I do not mean merely that you
have the instinct and intelligence which certain sagacious
animals of the lower creation have, nor yet that by natural
conscience, the embers of the primeval spiritual fire, you are
enabled dimly to discern between right and wrong, to perceive
that there is a power above you, and an immortal future before
you: I mean, that you all <i>as Christians</i> are partakers of a
new gift of knowledge&mdash;that you have within you, as one of
the ordinary graces of the Spirit of regeneration in Christ, that
Spirit which was given to guide men unto all truth, to convince
of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; the faculty of knowing
spiritual things&mdash;a faculty to be sustained in appointed
ways, and to be exercised upon the revelations of knowledge
contained in the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>I shall
not stay to prove this; you know that since in Christ all is
quickened, which died in Adam, knowledge must be revived.&nbsp;
You know that the Spirit of Christ is frequently spoken of as the
Imparter of light to all whom He visits; that the coming of
Christ to men, <i>externally</i> even, as a teacher, took away
all cloak and excuse for ignorance and sin; that to sin after
receiving the Spirit, is to sin against the knowledge of the
truth, knowledge attainable, if not attained; that under the
Gospel dispensation, the servant who knows not his Master&rsquo;s
will, is nevertheless to be beaten if he transgresses it, because
he might and should have known it; that to remain ignorant is to
bring upon us judicial ignorance; that from him that hath not
(that acts, <i>i.e.</i>, as though he had not), from him shall be
taken away even that he hath; that the light within us, if
treated as darkness, will become the greatest and most terrible
darkness.&nbsp; You know, too, that we are commanded to increase
and improve this gift, to grow in knowledge, to walk in the
light; and you know how to do it, by asking wisdom of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, by heeding what the Spirit says, and by
searching the Scriptures, the source of spiritual
knowledge.&nbsp; We all know&mdash;that is, we all have the
<i>power</i> of knowing&mdash;we all are required to know, we
shall all be judged as those who know, and we shall all be
rewarded according to our use or abuse, our growth, or falling
off in knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, is not this a solemn thought?&nbsp; Does not it exhibit
to us a great responsibility?&nbsp; Does not <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>it speak
stern reproof to our frequent and willing ignorance?&nbsp; How
little are many of us acquainted with <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the Father of our <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.&nbsp; What little
knowledge have we, and do we seek to have, of Providence, of
grace, of moral discipline, of duty, of prospects, hopes and
fears, of spiritual succour and spiritual assaults of time and
eternity, of probation and judgment, of heaven and hell.&nbsp; Is
there any other subject of which the vast majority of us are so
ignorant, and so contentedly or carelessly ignorant, as of that
which <span class="smcap">God</span> has made so easy to learn,
and has so imperatively required us to learn, the knowledge of
Him, of ourselves, and of His dealings with us, revealed to us in
the Bible, to be discerned by the Spirit within us?</p>
<p>Year after year passes away, and we realise no more, and feel
no more what <span class="smcap">God</span> is, what we are, what
we have to do, and why, and what awaits us.&nbsp; Chapter after
chapter of the Bible is read, or heard again and again, and what
we did not understand at first, we still do not understand; what
we did not feel at first, we still do not feel.&nbsp; Sermon
after sermon is preached, and our stock of knowledge after all is
just as much (is it always this?) as was forced upon us at
school, or in preparation for confirmation and first
communion.&nbsp; Restless and ever on the move in all other
respects, we are content to stand still here; ay, and if the
preacher strives to lead us on, by unfolding some great spiritual
truth as far as he can, by exhibiting and explaining some
difficult doctrine more fully than usual, too often <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>we withhold
the attention which we usually give him, and after he has done,
not unfrequently condemn his pains, and exclaim against his
learned and abstruse sermon.</p>
<p>Is not it so?&nbsp; Are not there many who cannot recollect a
time when they had less spiritual perception than they have now,
and who therefore are witnesses to themselves that they have not
grown in knowledge?&nbsp; Are not there many who are less
acquainted with the Bible than with any other book that has come
into their hands?&nbsp; Are not there many who, while they may
have familiarised themselves with the history, the geography, the
anecdotes so to speak of Holy Scripture, and the fanciful, often
daring, interpretations of unfulfilled prophecy, yet know
comparatively nothing of what <span class="smcap">God</span> is
to them, what they are to <span class="smcap">God</span>, what is
required of them, and what is promised or threatened?</p>
<p>Oh! brethren, how and why is this?&nbsp; How is it that the
Object of supreme love and fear is to us but a shadowy and
unintelligible name?&nbsp; How is it that we have no perception
of the ever-present, ever-speaking, ever-acting, all-important
Spirit?&nbsp; How is it that we have no intelligent or inquiring
thought of the heaven which we are bidden to seek, and of the
hell which we have to avoid; of the Master we are bound to serve;
of the business to which life is an apprenticeship; of the race
in which we are runners; of the warfare which we are enlisted to
wage; the weapons to be used; the <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>mode of fighting; the field of
battle; the foes we are opposed to; the punishment of desertion:
the reward of constancy; the prospects of victory; the perils of
defeat?&nbsp; Is not it that we are not impressed with the
responsibility of having this gift of knowledge? with the peril
of folding up in a napkin a precious talent given us to use and
improve?&nbsp; Is not it that we do not think seriously of the
existence of <span class="smcap">God</span>, of the possession of
His Spirit, of the reality of heaven and hell, of the obligations
of Christian service, of spiritual helps, and difficulties, and
perils?&nbsp; Is not it that we have not (which means that we do
not seek) that faith which is the substance of things hoped for,
and the evidence of things not seen, enabling us to realise and
grasp, as though it were a substance, that which is as yet but
future; and to behold plainly, with the eye of faith, that which
to natural sense is not perceptible?</p>
<p>Have but this faith, and you will soon add to it
knowledge.&nbsp; Concern yourselves about <span
class="smcap">God</span> only as much as you would about the man
with whom you have most to do in life, and from whom you have
most to expect or fear; treat religion as you would the business
by which you are to sustain natural life, and to make or mar your
temporal fortune; and then interest and desire (as much and more
than duty) will impel you to use every effort to acquaint
yourselves thoroughly with <span class="smcap">God</span>; to
understand the working and unravel the mysteries of religion; to
ascertain all particulars about <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>what you have to hope for or
fear&mdash;heaven and hell&mdash;angels and demons&mdash;the Holy
Ghost&mdash;and the spirit of evil.&nbsp; Deeper and deeper will
you drink of the well of knowledge; and each deep and frequent
draught will but quicken your thirst and impel you to drink
again.</p>
<p>But take care not to err in the other extreme: we know <i>in
part</i>, and are always to know in part only.&nbsp; Our
knowledge of allowed and enjoined things, though ever increasing,
shall never be perfect on this side of the grave.&nbsp; We are to
augment it as much as we can, but we must stand really face to
face with Christ, before we see Him as He is.&nbsp; Our grossness
must be refined, our souls and minds wholly transformed, and our
bodies glorified, before we can fully perceive and appreciate the
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; We must be in heaven to know thoroughly what
heaven is.&nbsp; We must have Christ for our audible teacher, and
angels for our prompting fellow scholars, and the eternal records
for our books, and all time spread out before us as a map, before
we can learn <i>perfectly</i>, what we are to spend this life and
exercise the Spirit of knowledge in acquiring <i>in
part</i>.&nbsp; And even then, as I said before, there are things
which we shall not be able to grasp, or fathom, or perceive
thoroughly.&nbsp; We shall never see <span
class="smcap">God</span> the Father visibly; we shall never
comprehend altogether a Being without beginning or end; we shall
never be omniscient or omnipresent.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> will treat us as trusty and privileged
friends, and reveal to us much that is not revealed here, <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and give us
new powers of understanding it.&nbsp; But He will not open to us
all the workings of the Divine mind.&nbsp; He will not transform
us into gods, nor even into angels.&nbsp; We shall still be
finite human beings, of limited understanding and limited
knowledge.&nbsp; The things which concern us we shall know fully;
the things which concern us not, we shall not know; just as the
angels desired once to look into, but were not able, the
mysteries (which did not concern them) of our redemption.</p>
<p>Well, then, if there is to be holy ground in heaven, which we
must not tread on with the shoes of idle curiosity; if there is
to be there a bush behind which we must not look; if even then
there shall be secret things which belong only to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and which we must not pry into; how
much more so here and now!&nbsp; How necessary to remember that
we are to know only in part; that we are not to seek to be wise
above what is written; that, respecting mysteries which concern
not us, it is distinctly charged: &ldquo;Draw not nigh
hither&rdquo;!</p>
<p>When God puts forth and reveals His arm, He proves to us,
indeed, that there is more of Him that is not revealed; but it is
profane to demand that it should be revealed.&nbsp; When He tells
us, that the world was created so many thousand years ago, He
proves that it was not before then; but He does not permit us to
inquire, what was then?&nbsp; When He tells us, that He made all
good, and that the devil introduced evil, He does it not that we
should inquire subtilly into the origin of evil.&nbsp; We <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>are to study
what is revealed, and not what is hidden.&nbsp; Where did <span
class="smcap">God</span> exist before the worlds were made?&nbsp;
What is existence without beginning?&nbsp; How was matter
produced out of nothing&mdash;evil out of good?&nbsp; How is it
possible for <span class="smcap">God</span> to have His will, and
man his?&nbsp; Why did not <span class="smcap">God</span> prevent
evil?&nbsp; Why does He now tolerate it?&nbsp; Why were fallen
angels not redeemed?&nbsp; Why is man not perfected without
trial?&nbsp; How can finite beings be infinitely rewarded or
punished?&nbsp; These, and the thousand other curious questions,
which perverse man is ever asking, are inquiries which He forbids
and baffles&mdash;which we may be sure provoke His
displeasure.</p>
<p>Check we, then, brethren, our wandering fancies, by the
thought that we are to know only in part; and that the only part
which we are to know is, that which concerns our duty, and hopes,
and fears; and our intelligent service and worship of Him.&nbsp;
There is no better sacrifice to God than that of curbed idle
curiosity.&nbsp; There is no better discipline than that which
requires us to trust in what we can only imperfectly
comprehend.&nbsp; There is no surer test of our earnestness about
salvation, than the ready renunciation of unnecessary inquiry,
and the steady, concentrated effort to understand that which was
revealed to be understood.</p>
<h2><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>SERMON
VI.<br />
CONFESSION.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Proverbs</span>, <span
class="smcap">xxviii</span>., 13.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;He that covereth his sins
shall not prosper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sin</span> unconfessed is sin
unforgiven.&nbsp; He who has not brought himself to the approved
publican&rsquo;s mind, and with that publican&rsquo;s deep,
heartfelt humiliation and self-abhorrence, poured out the
contrite entreaty, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> be
merciful to me a sinner;&rdquo; he who, as he stands or kneels
before the throne of grace, is not emptied of
self-justification&mdash;is not convinced that mercy alone can
save him&mdash;is not eager to embrace the only proffered
propitiation of rebels and outcasts (that afforded by the Son of
obedience and love), is still in the depths of
iniquity&mdash;still under the condemnation of the law:
&ldquo;The soul that sinneth, it shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor even
if he has this general sense (and confesses it) of sinfulness and
unworthiness, is he much nearer to pardon and justification
unless, besides, by diligent self-searching he has found out
wherein he is a sinner and unworthy, and, like penitent David,
makes mention before God of every ascertained act, and word, and
thought of offence; every omission, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>every transgression, and prays for
power to know himself better, that he may confess himself the
more fully.</p>
<p>I need not stay to prove to you that all this is
required.&nbsp; There are many precepts and many examples in the
Bible, which set forth clearly the necessity of both general
acknowledgment of sinfulness, and also special confession of
particular sins to <span class="smcap">God</span>, as preliminary
to pardon.</p>
<p>And we may easily see why it is so.&nbsp; All things are
indeed naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to
do; and He, therefore, needs no informing of our circumstances,
our wants and feelings, our griefs and burthens.&nbsp; But, by a
rule of His own establishing, He does not bless us in providence
or grace, unless we ask for the blessing, and assure Him that we
should appreciate it.&nbsp; When of His free love He had designed
to bestow great things on the Israelites, and had even
commissioned His prophets to make known the intention, He,
nevertheless, restrained the flow of His bounty by the condition,
&ldquo;I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel,
to do it for them.&rdquo; <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; He would have
men realise that they wanted the blessing; and He would have them
<i>acknowledge</i> their dependence on Him for the bestowal of
it.</p>
<p>And if this feeling, this acknowledgment and supplication were
required even when, if I may so speak, He longed to confer the
gift, and was standing <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>with it ready in His stretched out
hand, how much more requisite must they be when His face is
averted, and His heart displeased; when it is His <i>wrath</i>,
rather than His <i>love</i>, which is made ready to reveal
itself, and will presently reveal itself, unless it is deprecated
and propitiated, and His love won back?&nbsp; Yes, surely, in
such a case, we must arise and go to Him, like the prodigal,
acknowledging that we are not worthy to be called His
children.&nbsp; We must smite upon our breasts, like the
publican, and cry out of our distress, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We must win His general sympathy by the manifestation of our
contrition; we must tell Him, one by one, of the items of offence
which, of His mercy in Christ, we would have Him blot out of the
great book of His remembrance; and not visit with His threatened
vengeance.</p>
<p>We can have little fear of His offended justice, if we do not
thus guard against every particular exercise of it.&nbsp; We can
have but little appreciation of His pardoning grace, if we will
not be at the trouble of telling Him when and for what we want
it.&nbsp; And we can have but little sense of His awful holiness,
if&mdash;all unclean, and able only to be cleansed by Him <i>in
answer to our entreaty</i>, <i>and on the showing of our
stains</i>&mdash;we yet approach Him, and expect to be tolerated
in His presence, unconcernedly defiled, and in filthy rags.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ask, and ye shall have.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that
covereth his sins shall not prosper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When I
kept silence, my bones <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>waxed old through my roaring all the
day long.&nbsp; For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me. . .
.&nbsp; I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I
not hid.&nbsp; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and Thou forgavest the iniquity
of my sin.&nbsp; For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found.&rdquo; <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a></p>
<p>And there is a gracious purpose, a merciful regard for the
sinner&rsquo;s best interests, in this imposed law of general and
particular confession.&nbsp; The offering of frequent confession
will keep a man mindful of his state before God.&nbsp; It will
lead him to consider what he has to confess; and so, through
self-searching, he will come to self-knowledge: and the act of
describing each sin to <span class="smcap">God</span> will
operate in representing that sin faithfully to the sinner; so
that the very ordinance, which is properly the acknowledgment
before <span class="smcap">God</span> of sins realised,
regretted, and forsaken, will often serve to show the sinner, for
the first time, the sin which he has to repent of and
forsake.</p>
<p>And one other benefit will surely arise from this exercise,
namely, that the sinner will be deterred from a fresh commission
of that confessed sin; that, having ascertained what are his evil
propensities, what are the weak points in which Satan
successfully assails him, he will be more on his guard against
lapses, and wanderings, and defeats.&nbsp; He will nerve himself,
and fight more <i>certainly</i>; &ldquo;not <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>as one that
beateth the air.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will seek to be better covered
with the armour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and grasp more
resolutely the sword of the Spirit.&nbsp; He will go forth
conquering and to conquer.</p>
<p>To obtain pardon, then, for past sins, it is necessary (in
accordance with <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> law) to
confess them.&nbsp; To know ourselves, our difficulties,
failures, trials from within and without; to shame ourselves out
of sin, and to guide and encourage us to victory over it, it is
expedient (and <span class="smcap">God</span> has mercifully
required it) that we should tell out before Him, ever and anon,
all that we can rake up against ourselves; and not present even
that as a total, but beg Him to add to it the secret things, in
which we offend without knowing it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can tell how
oft he offendeth?&nbsp; O, cleanse Thou me from my secret
faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! my brethren, how high is the standard!&nbsp; How far do
many of us fall short of it!&nbsp; Where, among the frequenters
of the temple, are the abashed, and humbled, and contrite
penitents, proclaiming their sinfulness, and imploring pardon:
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> be merciful to me a
sinner&rdquo;?&nbsp; Where, among professed Christians, are the
imitators of David, communing with, searching out their spirit in
the night season, rising early, to tell out with sighs and pangs
each sin that they can discover; each renewal of it; each thought
of it?&nbsp; But an hour since, we all joined, or professed to
join, in words of general confession.&nbsp; Who felt and abashed
themselves as sinners?&nbsp; Who really confessed any sin to
<span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Presently, some of us will
take part <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>in a more solemn form, and draw nearer still to a
present <span class="smcap">God</span>, seeking most intimate
communion with Him.&nbsp; What sins are we going to confess, and
pray to be relieved from?&nbsp; How much of self-abasement and
contrition shall we take with us to the foot of the altar?&nbsp;
No further back than yesterday each one of us sinned in thought,
in word, or in deed; perhaps, in all three, How many of us
brought those sins to remembrance, last night or this morning, by
self-examination, and confessed them, and with contrition sought
pardon of them?&nbsp; Which of us has done this, and is wont to
do it, whenever wrong has been done, or right omitted?&nbsp;
Remember, there is no forgiveness, there is no favour with <span
class="smcap">God</span>, nor hope of heaven without it.&nbsp;
There is no knowledge of self, no perception of danger from
without, no spiritual progress.&nbsp; He that covereth his sin
shall not and <i>cannot</i> prosper.&nbsp; He walketh
independently, ungratefully, rebelliously&mdash;in his own way;
and the end of that way is death.</p>
<p>My brethren, think of these things; think of your imperative
duty, and your sovereign interest; and let close
self-examination, honest, heartfelt, contrite confession, be your
frequent and diligent exercise.&nbsp; Every morning settle what
you have to do and avoid; every evening consider what you have
done and omitted, and lay the account religiously before <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Daily dress and undress your
souls.&nbsp; Cleanse yourselves of what is amiss by confession
and repentance.&nbsp; Prepare yourselves for <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>future
success, by the examination of past failures.&nbsp; You cannot
approach <span class="smcap">God</span>: He will not approach you
(but for judgment), unless you have thus purified yourselves, and
put off the things that defile holy ground.</p>
<p>Thus much by way of reminder and entreaty respecting
confession to <span class="smcap">God</span>, general and
particular.&nbsp; But the question is asked in these days, and
being asked should not be left unanswered, whether, in any case,
and if so, in what, confession should also be made to any other
than <span class="smcap">God</span>?&mdash;whether it is ever
needful, or expedient, to uncover our sins, and make known our
spiritual burthens to our fellow man?</p>
<p>Now, any mindful reader of the Bible must be ready at once to
answer that, on Divine authority, it <i>is</i> sometimes
necessary, and often expedient.&nbsp; When we have injured
another, by word or deed; when we have defrauded him, misled him,
maligned him; provoked him to anger or displeasure, or only in
some secret way harmed him; we must, as a foremost duty, go and
acknowledge our fault, and obtain his forgiveness, or at least
leave nothing undone to obtain it.&nbsp; The rash striker, the
undutiful child, the dishonest tradesman, the unfaithful servant,
the seducer into any sin, the scandalmonger, the slanderer, the
base supplanter, the peacebreaker, may not atone for their
offences, may not have remission from <span
class="smcap">God</span>, but by the consent, or at least after
the sought consent, of the person offended against (which, of
course, implies previous acknowledgment <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and
confession of the offence).&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou bring thy gift
to the altar,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if thou approachest <span
class="smcap">God</span> in any way, to serve Him, or to seek His
blessing&mdash;&ldquo;and there rememberest that thy brother hath
aught against thee; Leave there thy gift before the
altar,&rdquo;&mdash;stop at the threshold of God&rsquo;s
presence&mdash;&ldquo;and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift.&rdquo; <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; And if the offence has been a
public one, to the scandal, or detriment, or provocation of a
community, the confession, too, must be public; so that St. Paul,
writing to the Corinthians, commands that such an offender should
be publicly censured, and put away from among them; and implies,
that he is not to be considered restored to the privileges of a
Christian, until the community, satisfied that he is penitent,
shall pronounce his forgiveness, and confirm their love towards
him.</p>
<p>In obedience to this Scripture rule, the ministers of our
Church are ordered to admit no notorious evil liver, nor any that
has done wrong to his neighbour in word or deed, to holy
communion; until, if he be an open offender, he has openly
declared himself to have truly repented (in some such form as
that of the Commination Service); or, if he be a private injurer,
until he has recompensed the parties to whom he has done
wrong.&nbsp; This discipline is not indeed enforced (as it should
be) by <i>man</i>.&nbsp; Sinners and saints mingle together in
the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> house, and alike
partake outwardly of the <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>tokens of spiritual approval and
blessing: but, assuredly, <span class="smcap">God</span>, who is
true, maintains jealously what man neglects; and refuses with
displeasure the offerings of the violators and despisers of His
law.&nbsp; Ay, and moreover places a firm and impassable barrier
of excommunication between Him and them, which shall not be
removed till the appointed reconciliation with man has been
made.&nbsp; In such cases, then, confession to man, to the
injured or offended, is necessary by the ordinance of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>In many other cases it is expedient, we might even say
enjoined, since inspired precepts recommend it.&nbsp; When, for
instance, the burthened conscience needs the sympathy, the
advice, the prayers of others to lighten it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confess
your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may
be healed.&rdquo; <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a>&nbsp; Or when,
again, the present consequences of a past sin can only be removed
by the active assistance of others, as when Achan was bidden by
Joshua&mdash;&ldquo;My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the <span
class="smcap">Lord God</span> of Israel, and make confession unto
Him; and tell <i>me</i> now what thou hast done; hide it not from
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a>&nbsp; In this latter case, <span
class="smcap">God</span> had signified that Achan was the
offender who had provoked His wrath against Israel; and Joshua,
the ruler of Israel, rightly demanded what was the offence, that
he might know how to do away with it.</p>
<p>Whenever, then, you feel spiritual perplexity, <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>heaviness of
soul which you cannot relieve, faintness of heart, need of
consolation or help in prayer, you may and should make known your
circumstances to some pious and wise Christian or Christians,
able and willing to advise, to succour, to intercede for
you.&nbsp; And whenever you cannot undo the consequences of your
sin without the active assistance of others, you are bound to
take to you partners in the work, and to communicate freely to
them what you have done, and wish undone.</p>
<p>It is not easy for me to say&mdash;your own feelings will
guide you best in such a matter&mdash;what confessor you should
choose.&nbsp; In some cases a parent would be the most fitting,
or a bosom friend; in others, a stranger, or slight acquaintance;
in some cases, again, a person of your own age and circumstances;
in others, a senior, or a superior.&nbsp; But if these fail to
serve and relieve you, then, in all cases, should you avail
yourselves of the ordinance of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and choose out your spiritual guide from among those whom He has
specially appointed to teach, and to console, and to
intercede.&nbsp; First, be sure that you cannot help yourselves,
because <span class="smcap">God</span> has imposed upon you an
individual responsibility, and entrusted to you powers of soul
and mind which you may not neglect to exercise.&nbsp; Then, if
you fail, go, call to yourselves that aid which seems best in
itself, and can be secured with least violence to your natural
feelings, and least injury to your social character and
position.&nbsp; If that <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>does not avail, then betake
yourselves to the ministers of religion, in the hope, nay, with
the assurance, that even if their learning, their habitual
examination of human nature&rsquo;s wants and failings, their
experience and interest in soul-work, should, after all, leave
them insufficient guides and helpers, still <span
class="smcap">God</span>, to Whom in the person of His
representatives you have thus come, will not let you depart
without a blessing, but will send down from heaven itself His
light, and comfort, and effectual strength.</p>
<p>One of two objections to this teaching may present itself to
some of those who hear me.&nbsp; Some of you, my brethren, may be
ready to assert, that human aid is not wanted in such
circumstances; and others, that to seek it of the clergy is to
draw near to the error and corrupt superstition of the
Romanists.</p>
<p>To the first, I would simply answer, that they cannot really
know much of spiritual life, if they suppose that he who would
lead such a life can always get on without external help, and
that they are little acquainted with <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mysterious ways, if they do not
know that He ever works by agents, in the religious and the
moral, as well as in the physical world.&nbsp; For their
enlightenment, let them inquire of the eminently spiritual, or
the marvellously reformed, and they will assuredly find, that
human helps and sympathies have formed many steps of the ladder
by which these have climbed so high towards heaven.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>The
other objectors merit a longer answer, because the charge they
make is a serious one; not only affecting individuals, but
casting a blot upon the good fame of our Church itself, which
unmistakeably teaches and recommends, in special cases, the use
of human and clerical confessors.</p>
<p>My dear brethren, let me ask you to bear with me
patiently.&nbsp; I have no party motives to serve, nor party
prejudices to indulge; <span class="smcap">God</span> is my
witness I reluctantly speak to you on this subject.&nbsp; I am
only induced to do so by the consideration that, when a religious
question is agitated out of doors, it is the minister of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> bounden duty to take it up in
the pulpit, and exhibit it, as far as he can, in scriptural
light, keeping aloof alike from prejudging approval, and from
capricious and worldly condemnation of the thing
maintained.&nbsp; &ldquo;The priest&rsquo;s lips should keep
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a></p>
<p>What, then, first, is the Romish use of confession?&nbsp;
Every lay member of the Church of Rome is obliged, at stated
times, to make a full and particular confession to a priest, of
every sin, of every kind, that he or she can call to
remembrance.&nbsp; No matter, that they are repented of and
confessed to <span class="smcap">God</span>; no matter, that the
way of escape from them is plain; that they have been escaped
from; out they must come, with all their preceding, accompanying,
and following circumstances; without reserve of any kind.&nbsp;
If but a <i>thought</i> of sin be <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>kept back; if the priest but
<i>fancy</i> that something is kept back; excommunication is
pronounced, and the offender, or supposed offender, is cut off
from all means of grace. <a name="citation76"></a><a
href="#footnote76" class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; And the
doctrine which guides this practice is, that no sin is ever
forgiven by <span class="smcap">God</span>, unless it has first
been confessed to a priest; and that, even then, though its
eternal punishment is remitted by their giving of absolution,
works of penance must be performed on its account, or a longer or
shorter period of suffering in purgatory will have to be
endured.</p>
<p>Such is Rome&rsquo;s course.&nbsp; I need scarcely tell you,
that our Church, in condemning the &ldquo;sacrament&rdquo; of
penance, and denying the existence of a purgatory, has swept away
the only pretences on which such a prying, unscriptural, and most
mischievous confessional could be maintained.</p>
<p>But, still, the Church of England has a doctrine and a
practice of confession.&nbsp; In the exhortation to holy
communion, it is enjoined, &ldquo;If there be any of you, who by
this means,&rdquo; (self-examination) &ldquo;cannot quiet his own
conscience herein, but requireth further comfort or counsel, let
him come to me, or to some other discreet and learned minister of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word, and open his grief,
that by the ministry of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
holy word, he may receive the benefit of absolution, together
with ghostly counsel and advice, to the quieting of his
conscience, <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>and avoiding of all scruple and
doubtfulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the Order of the Visitation of
the Sick it is directed: &ldquo;Here shall the sick person be
moved to make a special confession of his sins, if he feel his
conscience troubled with any weighty matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And let
it not be said, that these are Romish elements in a
&ldquo;tesselated ritual.&rdquo;&nbsp; The exhortation is a
Protestant composition; and the words that make it imperative on
us to move every sick person we visit to a special confession, if
he needs it, were added at the last review of the
Prayer-Book.</p>
<p>What, then, is the sum of Church teaching?&nbsp; Men are to
confess their sins to <span class="smcap">God</span> alone, with
a view to pardon and religious homage.&nbsp; (In certain cases,
they are advised to seek <i>assurance</i> of <i>absolution</i>
from the clergy.&nbsp; I dwell not on this now, because I
purpose, <span class="smcap">God</span> willing, to give the
subject full consideration on an early occasion. <a
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a>)&nbsp; When they find this confession
sufficient to procure spiritual peace and amendment of life, they
need not, and ought not, to make known their faults to
others.&nbsp; They are not to make their ministers partakers of
the thoughts and secrets of their breasts; they are not to look
to them for pardon; they are not to get rid of their
responsibility to <span class="smcap">God</span>, by accepting
penance at man&rsquo;s hand; they are not to seek direction from
a priest, in the ordinary ways of life; they are not to submit
themselves to close catechisings, and prying
investigations.&nbsp; But they are, when in doubt, in difficulty,
in overwhelming <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>grief, in all circumstances of spiritual helplessness,
so to reveal their lives and open their thoughts to a spiritual
officer, that he may, out of the treasure of his knowledge and
experience, and by virtue of his commission as a minister of holy
things, direct, and comfort, and strengthen them, more really and
effectually than he can in public sermons, from mere guessing at
their condition.&nbsp; When the public ministry suffices for
them, let them seek no more; when they need, likewise, private
ministry, by all means let them demand it: the Church binds us to
render what they ask.</p>
<p>This kind of confession has the hearty approval of spiritual
men of all ages, and all shades of theological opinion.&nbsp; All
our reformers urged it.&nbsp; Luther said he would rather lose a
thousand worlds than suffer private confession to be thrust out
of the Church.&nbsp; Calvin exhorted all who thought they would
be benefitted by it, to use it readily, and showed them, by
precise rules, how to do so.&nbsp; Puritans of old, so-called
evangelical ministers of our day&mdash;presbyterians,
anabaptists, wesleyans, independents, all maintain and practise
it now, though sometimes under other
names&mdash;&ldquo;consultation,&rdquo; &ldquo;history of
conversion,&rdquo; &ldquo;detailing of experiences.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Richard Baxter&rsquo;s characteristic words, exhibiting the true
spirit of Church teaching, and showing how nonconformists cling
to it in this case, are specially worthy of full recital.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;some will
say, that it is near to Popish auricular confession, which I here
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>persuade
Christians to; and it is to bring Christians under the tyranny of
the priests, and make them acquainted with all men&rsquo;s
secrets, and masters of their consciences.&nbsp; To the last, I
say&mdash;to the railing devil of this age&mdash;no more, but the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> rebuke thee.&nbsp; If any
minister have wicked ends, let the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of heaven convert him, or root him out of His Church, and cast
him among the weeds and briers.&nbsp; But is it not the known
yoke of sensuality to cast reproaches upon the way and ordinances
of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Who knoweth not, that it
is the very office of the ministry, to be teachers and guides to
men in matters of salvation, and overseers over them. . . . I am
confident, many a thousand souls do long strive against anger,
lust, blasphemy, worldliness, and trouble of conscience, to
little purpose, who, if they would but have taken <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> way, and sought out for help,
and opened all their case to their minister, they might have been
delivered in a good measure long ago.&nbsp; And for Popish
confession, I detest it: we would not persuade men that there is
a necessity of confessing every sin to a minister before it can
be pardoned.&nbsp; Nor do we it in a perplexed formality only at
one time of the year, nor in order to Popish pardons or
satisfactions; but we would have men go for physic to their
souls, as they do for their bodies, when they feel they have
need.&nbsp; And let me advise all Christian congregations to
practise this excellent duty more.&nbsp; See that you knock
oftener at your pastor&rsquo;s door, and ask his advice in all
your pressing necessities.&nbsp; Do <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>not let him sit quiet in his study
for you: make him know by experience, that the tenth part of a
minister&rsquo;s labour is not in the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more quotation: it will be heard with respect when I tell
you it is from the Bishop of Lincoln&rsquo;s sermons on
repentance: &ldquo;As ministers should be, by their profession,
usually the best advisers in cases of conscience, and are, or
ought to be, every penitent&rsquo;s ready and sympathising
friends, so to them the stricken or perplexed soul will often
have recourse.&nbsp; And thus, there is a sense in which those
dreaded words, &lsquo;confession to the priest,&rsquo; (in one
sense, justly dreaded, for the iniquity of ages is upon them) may
express an edifying practice, and even at times a duty.&rdquo; <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>Thus, my brethren, have I endeavoured to set before you, the
true merits of the question, &ldquo;Ought man to confess to
man?&rdquo; to remind you what is required, what is allowed and
recommended, what is forbidden by Scripture, and the Witness and
Keeper of Scripture, the Church.&nbsp; Endeavour, all of you, to
learn from the subject, charity and wisdom.&nbsp; If you feel
that you need not this use of confession, thank God for your easy
circumstances; but, blame not, and, above all, dare not to
ridicule, those who have need.&nbsp; If you want it, by all means
seek it; we may not refuse it.&nbsp; To all of you, I would say,
at all times regard your clergyman as indeed an appointed
spiritual friend and adviser, and so make use of him; but,
especially <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>in sickness, when you call him to your bedside, so far,
at least, admit him to your confidence, and enlighten him with
respect to your spiritual state, that his instruction may be
pointed, and his prayers appropriate; and so his visits
blessed.&nbsp; Oh! look not upon us as mere Sunday lecturers, or
mechanical readers of prayers, in whom you have no week-day
interest, and from whom no benefit is to be derived, but what may
be had in church.&nbsp; Degrade not our office, nor ignore our
authority, nor slight our willingness to use both for your
temporal and eternal good.&nbsp; Nor, on the other hand, exalt us
to the false position of spiritual despots&mdash;lords of
men&rsquo;s consciences; idols occupying the place of <span

of Christ; and your servants for His sake.&nbsp; Make use of our
ministry as a ministry, and doubt not but <span

accomplish by it, all the ends for which He appointed it.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>SERMON
VII.<br />
FORGIVENESS.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Psalm</span> <span class="smcap">cxxx</span>.,
4.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;There is forgiveness with
Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all know what <i>forgiveness of
sin</i> means, namely, remission of the punishment due to it by
Divine sentence, and restoration of the offender to the position
and privileges of the righteous.&nbsp; We all know, too, our
individual need, our ever fresh recurring need of this
forgiveness; and we also know, all of us, that forgiveness is
granted only for the sake and merits of the <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, and on fixed
conditions.</p>
<p>Alas! my brethren, how little do we <i>feel</i> what we
know.&nbsp; With what vain speculations, what idle dreams, what
perverse errors do we too often darken knowledge!</p>
<p>Forgiveness, ransom from eternal death, deliverance from the
terrible inflictions of Almighty wrath, gracious reception into
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> own family, and full
participation of His inexhaustible love and benediction, how can
sinners consent not to value this when given or offered, not to
desire and seek it when needed?&nbsp; Yet so it is.&nbsp; There
is many an <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>one of our poorest possessions which we cherish more
fondly; there is many an unobtained bauble which we would make
more real effort to obtain.</p>
<p>Ask yourselves, seriously, and answer to yourselves, honestly,
my fellow-sinners, whether it is not so.&nbsp; All of you believe
that you have been forgiven some thing, nay, many things.&nbsp;
You do not suppose that you are carrying about, each one of you,
the unmitigated condemnation of original sin; the full burthen of
every transgression and omission of your whole lives, from the
first exercise of your self-will in childhood, to that in which
you offended but an hour since.&nbsp; You know, indeed, that much
remains written against you; but you believe that much more has
been blotted out; that <span class="smcap">God</span> has been
propitiated and reconciled to fallen man by the sacrifice and
intercession of His Son; that wrath has been displaced by love;
that the way of return is open; that the ears of mercy are
unclosed; that the arms of grace are stretched out to unfold all
those, who by birth inherited banishment, and were kept in exile
by the fiery sword which turned every way and allowed none to
pass to the paradise of bliss and the tree of life.&nbsp; What
Adam lost, that and much more has Christ won.&nbsp; In Him you
already have regained much; through Him you may have all and
abound.</p>
<p>This you know.&nbsp; How much of it do you feel?&nbsp; Where
is your joy of deliverance? where your heart-leapings of praise?
where your homage of gratitude for what has been forgiven?&nbsp;
And where <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>are your yearnings, your wrestling prayers, your
strenuous efforts after the forgiveness yet needed? the cries and
struggles of drowning men, grasping in your fresh peril the again
stretched out rope of deliverance; imploring to be taken up once
more into the ark of salvation; to be landed yet again on the
shore of hope?&nbsp; Alas! where?&nbsp; Is not forgiveness
obtained, unheeded; forgiveness not obtained, unsought?&nbsp; Not
altogether, <span class="smcap">God</span> be praised!&nbsp;
There are some who never forget their deliverance; who have
learnt from it gratitude for the past, and hope and direction for
the future.&nbsp; There are some who are wont to gaze upon the
book of the Divine account of them (that is, so much of it as is
revealed), and as they gaze, to keep moist with the tears of
humble penitence and love, the red stain of Christ&rsquo;s blood,
which hides, nay, has obliterated so many of the black items
against them; and who, seeing how much is cancelled, cannot bear
that aught should remain uncancelled, and therefore rest not, nor
cease from pleading and entreating, while one single black figure
is uncovered by the crimson mark of remission.</p>
<p>Some of you, my brethren, surely there are, who, looking back,
perhaps upon a youth of wild and wicked folly, or a manhood of
worldliness, or much of an old age of dull, spiritual
indifference, from the thraldom of which, by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace, you have been delivered,
whose fearful guilt, you have reason to believe, has been
remitted; some of you, <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>I say, surely there are, who so
appreciate the obtained mercy as to think nothing comparable to
it, no gratitude enough for it; and who, therefore, when need of
more forgiveness arises (as, of course, it constantly does),
betake yourselves early, with the first fruits of your desires,
and the quick steps of urgent, craving want, to the fountain that
ever floweth, by whose waters alone you can be cleansed and
refreshed.&nbsp; Yes, there are such; a few of them; and they do
value, they do seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>But, do the many?&nbsp; Judge for yourselves, brethren.&nbsp;
Trace back, all of you, as far as you can, the course of your
respective lives; review your old habits, your former careers of
transgression or omission; or pick out some single sin, if you
will of recent date; some one of those many offences against
which <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> wrath is pronounced,
and on account of which it must descend, unless forgiveness is
secured.&nbsp; Is it a lie, a filthy jest, a profane speech, a
word of slander?&nbsp; Is it a thought of malice, an encouraged
lust, a meditated misdeed?&nbsp; Is it an act of fraud?&nbsp; Did
you use false balances, or adulterate your wares, or drive an
unfair bargain, exacting more, or giving less than was
right?&nbsp; Did you pilfer from your employer, or rob him of
your bought service, or betray his interest?&nbsp; Is it direct
ungodliness?&nbsp; Did you act in defiance of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> known commandment?&nbsp; Did you
profane His holy day?&nbsp; Did you disregard His fear?&nbsp; Did
you withhold aught that He claims of service, of <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>prayer, of
praise, of money, time, talents, influence, of example?</p>
<p>Brethren, most of you follow, or have followed, some bad
habit; at least, each of you has committed, and can now bring to
quick remembrance, some one evident, wilful sin.&nbsp; Now <span
class="smcap">God</span> forbade that sin, and warned you of
condemnation if you did it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>
witnessed its commission.&nbsp; His displeasure arose; He
registered it in heaven; He wrote down <i>death</i>, <i>eternal
death</i>, against it; and angels, beholding what He did,
prepared themselves to fly with the lightning&rsquo;s speed and
execute that sentence, at the first motion of His commanding
will.&nbsp; The sentence is not executed.&nbsp; The sin has, or
has not, brought you inconvenience, perplexity, contempt, pain,
sickness, loss.&nbsp; But, at any rate, it has <i>not</i> brought
you death.&nbsp; Brethren, why not?&nbsp; Do you know? do you
imagine? do you care?&nbsp; Is the sentence still impending, or
has it been reversed?&nbsp; Are you forgiven? or have you yet to
seek forgiveness?&nbsp; Do you concern yourselves at all about
the matter?&nbsp; If you have forgiveness, do you really value
it?&nbsp; If you have it not, do you really seek it?&nbsp; Oh!
judge yourselves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>I can imagine the comparatively religious ready to urge,
&ldquo;Thus saying, you reproach us also; you bring all in
guilty; you do not allow that any are in the right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even so, brethren, for there is none clear in this matter.&nbsp;
The standard of right is so high, that all come short of
it.&nbsp; Infirmity <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>checks the accomplishment of our best purposes.&nbsp;
Sin defiles even our holy things.&nbsp; The flesh ever resists
the spirit, and too often blinds and deadens it.&nbsp; And so our
warmest desires are often all but cold; our greatest industry is
but little removed from sloth.&nbsp; We <i>cannot</i> do the
things, nor think the thoughts that we would, in
perfection.&nbsp; Let us gather consolation from the fact, that
this is a law even of our regenerate being, when we fall short of
what we desire and aim at; but let us not thereby justify
ourselves in spiritual indifference, nor suppose that a general
culpability exonerates the individual.&nbsp; Much will always be
amiss, through the opposition of the flesh, and through the
difficulty of discerning spiritual things; and much allowance we
may hope will be made for us: but, much that <i>is</i> amiss,
might be corrected, and ought to be; nay, unless it is, we shall
be without excuse.&nbsp; It is so, be assured, in this matter of
forgiveness.&nbsp; At the best, we shall never, in this world,
appreciate it fully, when bestowed; nor seek it with sufficient
earnestness, when needed.&nbsp; But, if we concern ourselves to
think right thoughts about it; if we ascertain more clearly what
it is, and how obtained, we shall speedily become more grateful
for it, more eager to obtain it, more sure partakers of it.&nbsp;
Let me throw out a few suggestions, which, by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessing, may help to bring us
nearer to this better state.</p>
<p>First, consider what Divine forgiveness is.&nbsp; It is not
capricious reversal of the sentence, &ldquo;The <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>soul that
sinneth it shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Divine justice does not give
up its claim.&nbsp; Divine truth does not belie itself; Divine
resoluteness become fickle.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>
is not a man, that He should repent, or that He should say and
not do, or that He should come to love what once He hated.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span> might have been freely reconciled
to the transgressor, if He had not made transgression sin.&nbsp;
He might, even then, have left the sinner alone, imposing no
other punishment than exile from His presence, if He had not
solemnly declared, &ldquo;In the day that thou eatest thereof,
thou shalt surely die.&rdquo;&nbsp; But now, His holiness, His
justice, and His truth are irrevocably pledged to banish and
destroy transgressors.&nbsp; It can never be otherwise.&nbsp;
Holiness cannot tolerate near unholiness: like Satan from heaven,
like Adam and Eve from paradise, it must be cast out.&nbsp;
Justice cannot acquit the guilty.&nbsp; Truth can never say,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not die,&rdquo; to him to whom it has already
said, &ldquo;Thou shalt die.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no such
forgiveness.&nbsp; If you transgress, you are a sinner; if you
sin, you are condemned; if you are condemned, you must die.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span> has said it, and there is no
variableness, or shadow of turning, in Him.</p>
<p>We are wont to think otherwise.&nbsp; We fancy that sin,
though wrong, is not destructive: we wrap ourselves in false
security, and flatter and mislead others, by a perverse assurance
that <span class="smcap">God</span> will not be extreme to mark
what is done amiss.&nbsp; Yea, we think we have Scripture warrant
for so doing.&nbsp; We read of Divine promises which were <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>never
realised, and Divine threats which were never executed; and we
gather from them that, like our poor fickle selves, <span
class="smcap">God</span> easily goes back from His resolution of
favour or wrath.</p>
<p>But let us look again at those promises and threats, and we
shall see that, if they were not fulfilled, it was not because
<span class="smcap">God</span> changed, but because the objects
changed on whom He had resolved to operate, for good or
evil.&nbsp; Jerusalem (bound to <span class="smcap">God</span> by
a covenant of allegiance) was promised perpetual
preservation.&nbsp; Jerusalem forsook the allegiance, and
therefore was destroyed.&nbsp; Nineveh&rsquo;s cry of wickedness
provoked the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to threaten it with
destruction within forty days; but when those forty days were
expired there was no cry of <i>wickedness</i> to be answered; but
a cry of repentance, a pledge of amendment, a nation&rsquo;s
voice and posture of worship.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> did not change, but Nineveh did.&nbsp;
The judgment was ready to fall; but there was no object for it to
fall upon, and so it fell not.&nbsp; If the righteous ceases to
be righteous, the promises made to his righteousness cannot be
fulfilled; if the sinner becomes sinless, the sentence of sin
cannot be executed upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;At what instant,&rdquo;
says <span class="smcap">God</span>, by Jeremiah, &ldquo;I shall
speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up,
to pull down, and to destroy it; If that nation, against whom I
have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil
that I thought to do unto them.&nbsp; And at what instant I shall
speak concerning a nation, and concerning a <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>kingdom, to
build and to plant it; If it do evil in my sight, that it obey
not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I
would benefit them.&rdquo; <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; And the like
is elsewhere declared of individuals.</p>
<p>Thus only does <span class="smcap">God</span> change His word;
thus only is there forgiveness with Him.&nbsp; The sinner must
change his sin, for sinlessness; and then for wrath he shall have
favour.&nbsp; But this change he cannot make.&nbsp; He cannot
wipe out or undo the past; he cannot bring a clean thing out of
an unclean; he cannot repair the breaches in his soul; he cannot
strengthen the things that are ready to perish.&nbsp; Vain, then,
is his idle trust in the non-fulfilment of a published threat;
and vain are all his efforts to avert that threat.&nbsp; While he
is a sinner, <span class="smcap">God</span> will not forgive him;
and a sinner he can never cease to be.</p>
<p>But, what man cannot do himself, Christ has done for
him.&nbsp; Having in His own person satisfied the Divine law, and
stood sinless and accepted before the Father, He has made Himself
the human source of faculties and graces, by which other men,
joined to Him, may partake of the infinite merits of His
atonement, His tasting of death for every man; and may also be
cleansed, and restored, and strengthened, and become again
sinless; escaping the guilt, and putting away the corruption of
sin.&nbsp; There is <i>such</i> forgiveness.&nbsp; Mark, it is
not an indulgent Father&rsquo;s concession to the mere request <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>of His loved
Son.&nbsp; It is not, again, such a substitution of the innocent
for the guilty, that no more account of sinners is taken; nor is
it a compromise by which <i>one</i> death is accepted instead of
<i>many</i>.&nbsp; It is a merited power, vested in the <span
class="smcap">God</span>-<span class="smcap">Man</span>, to be
the source of absolution and sanctification.&nbsp; It is a
purchased right to apply that power to all who will observe
prescribed conditions.&nbsp; Christ holds and exercises that
power.&nbsp; It is in Him to save whom He will; it is in Him to
desire to save all.</p>
<p>But still, He has not handed over the forgiveness to
all.&nbsp; Nay, let it be said with all reverence, He
<i>cannot</i> so hand it over.&nbsp; Men must come to Him for it;
they must be joined to Him to derive it; they must become like
Him to be saved by Him.&nbsp; On conditions He received the power
of salvation, and on conditions He imparts it.&nbsp; Those who do
not observe these conditions, so far from escaping condemnation
through what He has done, and what He has attained unto, do
thereby become subject to surer and worse condemnation.&nbsp; The
same work, the same authority, which made Him the Saviour of all
men, made Him also the Judge of all; and imposed the inflexible
law, that every one that would not be saved by Him must be
destroyed by Him.</p>
<p>Now, in this day of grace, He is labouring to save: and He
will save to the uttermost all who seek His salvation.&nbsp; But,
by and by, He must come to judge; and then, whosoever has not
been already saved, must be utterly destroyed.&nbsp; Are <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>you
forgiven?&nbsp; Christ has forgiven you.&nbsp; Are you seeking
forgiveness?&nbsp; If you seek it aright, Christ will bestow
it.&nbsp; Are you not forgiven?&nbsp; Will you not seek
forgiveness?&nbsp; Then, rely upon it, you must be condemned; and
that not only or chiefly by the law, but by the Gospel, the
dispensation on the one hand of unspeakable goodness, on the
other of unpardonable severity.&nbsp; If Christ is not made your
Saviour, He will be your destroyer.&nbsp; There is forgiveness
with Him.&nbsp; There is no forgiveness elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let me press this upon you, dear brethren, even though in so
doing I repeat what I have already said.&nbsp; There is no
forgiveness with <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Father,
apart from Christ, the Saviour.&nbsp; There is no forgiveness,
for the Saviour&rsquo;s sake, to those who do not belong to the
Saviour.&nbsp; You must not go to the Father and plead, while you
continue in your sin, that, since One has died for sins, there is
no longer any such thing as sin.&nbsp; You must not suppose that
holiness, and justice, and truth are set at nought in all other
cases, because they have been maintained in one.&nbsp; You must
not expect that He who once refused forgiveness, now freely
grants it to the same persons in the same state; that He is
changed, and, therefore, you need not be.&nbsp; No! to find any
comfort in the assurance, &ldquo;There is forgiveness with
Thee,&rdquo; and to verify it in your own case, you must have
observed, and be still observing, the prescribed
conditions.&nbsp; You must have become Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ
have become <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>yours.&nbsp; You must have obtained the pardon from Him,
and you must hold it through Him; and He must testify thereof,
and plead for you, ere the Father will pronounce His absolution:
&ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath put away thy
sins: thou shalt not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how is all this to be done?&nbsp; Not by idly assenting to
the truth, that it ought to be done.&nbsp; Not by mere thinking
and talking of Christ.&nbsp; Not by working upon your feelings,
and warming your affections, by the contemplation of Him as a
historical character; not even by making mention of Him in your
prayers, and pleading His merits, and asking to be wrapped in His
imputed righteousness; but by intelligently, and heartily, and
actively observing the conditions and using the means of
salvation, which Christ has proposed to you, and put within your
reach.</p>
<p>As soon as Christ had accomplished His work on earth, and had
been exalted to be the new head of the human race, the source of
pardon and grace, calling in the powers of His Godhead, He
established supernatural means whereby other men might be
actually joined, and kept joined, to Him, and might derive from
Him the properties and privileges of a renewed and perfected
nature.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit, the third Person of the blessed
Trinity, became the wonderful agent to effect and maintain this
union and communication, providing mysteriously for the gradual
subjugation and destruction of the old nature, with its guilt and
proneness to sin, and for the development and establishment of <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>spiritual
excellence in all those who become objects of His
operations.&nbsp; To become such objects, it is necessary that
men should be prequalified (and He gives them the power, if they
ask it), by realising the misery and condemnation of their
natural state, by sorrowing over and renouncing their sins, by
desiring pardon and grace, and by believing that Christ had them
to bestow; and, then, after becoming thus prequalified, it is
further necessary, that they should make appointed use of certain
outward ordinances, in the due observance of which He pledges
Himself to meet them, and to apply to them the merits and the
graces, in the possession of which they shall be accounted dead
with Christ unto sin, and alive with Him unto
righteousness.&nbsp; On none but those thus qualified will the
Spirit operate; and on these only, when they come to Him and
invite His operation in appointed ways.&nbsp; Such, my brethren,
is the doctrine of forgiveness; such is the law of its
bestowal.&nbsp; There is forgiveness with God of this kind, and
on these terms; but there is no other forgiveness.</p>
<p>It is because we are not fully persuaded of this truth, that
we are so indifferent, so apathetic, so unthankful, so
unrighteous.&nbsp; We do not appreciate forgiveness, through not
understanding it; we do not duly seek it, through not considering
how only it is to be obtained.</p>
<p>Dear brethren, let us strive to be wiser and better.&nbsp;
First, let us qualify ourselves for the application to us of
forgiveness, by realising the guilt <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and condemnation of sin; by
convincing ourselves that we are sinners, and by ascertaining in
what we sin; by sorrowing for sin, loathing it, and desiring to
get free of it; by giving up its work, forsaking its haunts, and
restoring, as far as may be, its plunder (<i>i.e.</i>, by
labouring to undo what we have done amiss).&nbsp; Then let us
meditate on pardon, and holiness; on the happy freedom and
glorious privileges of those who are forgiven and sanctified in
Christ, till our reason and affections unite in demanding that
our lips and lives should seek forgiveness and
sanctification.&nbsp; We have already learned <i>where</i> and
<i>how</i> to seek.&nbsp; Let us hasten to use our
knowledge.&nbsp; Let us seek the Spirit where He is to be found;
let us submit ourselves to Him, and ask His blessing in the
prescribed ways; the ways revealed to us in the Bible, and made
accessible to us through the Church of Christ: baptism once, for
death and burial with Christ unto sin, and new birth unto
righteousness; holy communion frequently, for the sustenance of
the new life, the meat and drink of the Spirit; and the ministry
of reconciliation ever, as the constant salve for the
soul&rsquo;s constant wounds.</p>
<p>Commending to your full and serious consideration the great
importance of all the Gospel-ordinances, and bidding you remember
(and profit by the remembrance) the sin and danger of neglecting
any one of them, let me now confine your attention, for a few
minutes, to the application of forgiveness by the authorised
ministers of reconciliation, <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>in what is called ministerial
absolution.&nbsp; Whenever you draw near to <span
class="smcap">God</span> in the sanctuary, and make a public
confession of your sins, whether in the ordinary daily service,
or in the office for the holy communion, immediately after such
confession, the priest is directed to stand up and pronounce what
is called an absolution; in the one case declaring, that
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> pardoneth and
absolveth,&rdquo; in the other, praying that He may do so.&nbsp;
Whenever private scruples and peculiar spiritual difficulties
keep you from the holy communion, you are exhorted to go to some
discreet and learned minister, that you may receive the benefit
of absolution; and whenever you are laid on a bed of sickness,
and the clergyman is summoned to your side, he is directed to
move you to a special confession, if you feel your conscience
troubled by any weighty matter, and if you humbly and heartily
desire it, to absolve you from all your sins, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; All of you
know that such things are to be found in the Prayer-Book.&nbsp;
Some of you treat them with perfect indifference, caring not that
they are there, neither assenting to them or opposing them.&nbsp;
Others accept the poor explanation, that they are mere kind,
comfortable delusions for weak minds.&nbsp; Others kick against
them, and denounce them as relics of Popery and instruments of
priestcraft, indignantly repelling the notion, that there is any
such forgiveness promised or allowed by the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Hear me
dispassionately, dear brethren, while in few words (and, <span
class="smcap">God</span> knows, without any party bias) I
endeavour to vindicate the Church&rsquo;s teaching; and to guard
it against both superstitious misuse and profane contempt.&nbsp;
You know, of course, that Christ, in His life-time on earth,
before His passion, commissioned certain disciples to go before
Him into every city whither He Himself would come, and when they
entered into any house, to pronounce peace upon its tenants, with
the assurance that His peace should, in such case, always rest
upon them, if they were worthy.&nbsp; You know, too, that just
before His ascension, He invested the apostles with the power of
remitting and retaining sins; and that they both exercised that
power themselves, by absolving and excommunicating, and also
handed it on to others&mdash;so that St. Paul tells the
Corinthian presbyters, that to whomsoever they forgive anything,
He forgives also, and that his forgiveness is the forgiveness of
Christ.&nbsp; And you likewise know (if you are conversant with
Church history) that the doctrine of ministerial absolution, and
the practice of administering it, have been steadily maintained
in all parts of the Church, from the apostolic age to the
present.</p>
<p>In one place, or time, the doctrine has been distorted; in
another, the practice has been abused: but everywhere, and at all
times, by Greeks and Romanists, by high-Churchmen, and by not a
few low-Churchmen, it has been, and is asserted, that <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Christ gave
by commission, and continues by His promise to be always present
with His Church, power and command to use ministerial
absolution.&nbsp; The Church of England claims that delegated
power, and obeys that positive command.&nbsp; She does not
blasphemously exalt her clergy, and plant them on the throne of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, to usurp His prerogative&mdash;to
be judges between good and evil, and awarders of favour or wrath;
nor, on the other hand, does she degrade them to mere voluntary
reporters, such as any of yourselves might be, of statements
contained in a published revelation: she sends them forth to
minister, as in other respects, so in this, the grace which
Christ would communicate through them for the good of the fold,
whereof they are under-shepherds.&nbsp; It is nothing of their
own that they minister; they can claim no honour, nor thanks, for
ministering it, and woe to them if they withhold it when rightly
sought; but to them it is intrusted to minister, and through
their ministry it is to be sought.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the Father, the primary Giver of every
good thing, is nowhere directly approachable.&nbsp; Christ, the
second Adam, to Whom all that pertains to man&rsquo;s salvation
is committed, sits at the right hand of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the Father, and operates upon man only
through the agency of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the Holy Spirit, does not convey
Himself spontaneously and independently of means into every
heart, but connects the gifts of His presence and working power,
with certain outward ordinances, <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>administered by appointed agents, and
promised to be efficacious in all faithful recipients.&nbsp; We
sprinkle with water in baptism, and, if there be no unworthiness
in the person we sprinkle, the Holy Spirit then and there
regenerates.&nbsp; We administer blessed bread and wine, and, on
like conditions, <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Spirit
conveys into the recipient&rsquo;s heart the spiritual food of
Christ&rsquo;s body and blood.&nbsp; We say to those who have
confessed their sins, &ldquo;He pardoneth and absolveth;&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span> pardon and
deliver you from all your sins;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;By virtue of
His authority, I absolve thee from all thy sins:&rdquo; and in
the case of every real penitent, there is then, there, and
thereby forgiveness from <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We
do not bid you look to us for pardon; we tell you plainly that we
cannot pardon you; but we distinctly maintain, that if you want
pardon, you must seek it in appointed ways; that this is an
appointed way; that none have due recourse to it, and fail of
spiritual blessing; that those who despise it despise not men,
but <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Brethren, thus soberly and scripturally regard the
Church&rsquo;s ordinance of absolution.&nbsp; On the one hand, do
not superstitiously look upon it as an inherent power, which any
priest can give to whom he will, and withhold from whom he will;
or as an indemnity, to be bestowed without conditions, to operate
as a charm in absolving those who have not desired, nor prepared
themselves for forgiveness; and, on the other hand, do not make
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>light of
its true exercise, and forego opportunities of having it applied
to yourselves, according to Christ&rsquo;s appointment, and your
several needs.&nbsp; Prepare yourselves duly for it, and heartily
accept the ministry of it, and give <span
class="smcap">God</span> the glory.&nbsp; Yes! be sure you give
<span class="smcap">God</span> the glory.&nbsp; Use the means,
and reverence them, because <span class="smcap">God</span> has
instituted them; but let the gift be more thought of, and let the
Giver be adored.&nbsp; When, with penitent hearts and humble
lips, you have made your open confession, and the herald&rsquo;s
consequent proclamation of pardon is ringing in your ears,
bethink you that it is <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
forgiveness which is being offered to your acceptance.&nbsp;
Bless Him for the ordinance; but look through it to the Spirit
who is present in it, to the Saviour who sent the Spirit, to the
Father who provided the Saviour, and let the vision both convince
you of the sinfulness and condemnation of sin (which could only
be put away by such a wonderful contrivance, and such continued
operation of the Blessed Trinity), and also prompt you to value
the forgiveness which <span class="smcap">God</span> has so much
at heart, and so labours to bestow.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
forgiveness with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Take to yourselves the
unspeakable comfort of so sweet an assurance when it is offered;
but be sure that you always respond to it, out of grateful and
resolute hearts: &ldquo;Therefore, O <span
class="smcap">God</span>, shalt Thou be feared, and served, and
loved.&rdquo;</p>

THE PRINCIPLE OF OFFERINGS TO GOD.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">II. <span
class="smcap">Samuel</span>, <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>.,
24.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither will I offer . . . unto the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> my <span class="smcap">God</span> of
that which doth cost me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a thrice enforced precept of
the law that none should appear before <span
class="smcap">God</span> empty; that when men drew near to Him to
celebrate His past mercies and deliverances, to ask for
blessings, to deprecate wrath, to render thanks, to acknowledge
dependence on His providence, they should at the same time
present unto Him some offering of their substance.&nbsp; And
this, be it observed, was not a mere temporary ordinance.&nbsp;
It was not, like the sacrifices of bulls and goats, a ceremonious
shadowing forth and pleading of the one sacrifice by which alone
<span class="smcap">God</span> could be approached and
propitiated.&nbsp; It was a free-will offering, an acknowledgment
that all things come of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and that
all things, though intrusted to them, belonged still to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It was a confession of His
Lordship, an act of homage, an exhibition of gratitude, a pledge
of readiness to yield all that He might require.&nbsp; As such,
it was <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>to be offered whenever man perceived <span
class="smcap">God</span> to be operating upon, or for him, or
whenever he would have <span class="smcap">God</span> to be thus
operating; it was to be presented at prescribed places, and under
prescribed circumstances, which rendered pains and exertion
necessary in the offerer; and it was to be of a kind and in a
measure which should make it a real sacrifice&mdash;the giving up
of something valuable and valued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man shall
give as he is able,&rdquo; says Moses.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not
offer unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; exclaims David, &ldquo;of that
which doth cost me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the Gospel, this duty is not only continued, but, like
all the other moral sanctions of the law, enlarged and
spiritualised.&nbsp; We Christians are to present ourselves, our
souls and bodies, continually, as a reasonable sacrifice unto
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We are to give up our
wills, our powers, our affections, our time, our substance, our
lives to Him.&nbsp; Our prayer is to be instant; our praise
continual; our sacrifice perpetual; our offering all that we are
and have.&nbsp; He who withholds anything from <span
class="smcap">God</span>, gives Him nothing.&nbsp; He who does
not deny himself, denies <span class="smcap">God</span>; he who
loves any one or anything more than <span
class="smcap">God</span>, hates <span class="smcap">God</span>;
he who bestows more thought and pains, and spends more of his
substance on any other object than on religion, takes no thought,
bestows no pains, spends none of his substance on <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Lip-service, stinted service,
careless or partial service is no service; easy religion, cheap
religion, intermittent religion is no <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>religion.&nbsp; Religion, to be
worthy of the name, must cost something; yea, and much&mdash;much
thought, much feeling, much affection, much labour, much
self-denial, much submission, much renunciation, much cheerful
sacrifice of self and substance.&nbsp; The only limit to our
offering is to be our capability; the only time when we may
forbear to offer it, is when <span class="smcap">God</span> gives
us no opportunity.&nbsp; Hence it was, that the young man who
would not sell all that he had, and give to the poor, and follow
Christ whithersoever He went, could not be His disciple.&nbsp;
Hence it is, that selfishness, and worldliness, and pride, and
self-glorying, and covetousness, are such grievous sins.&nbsp;
Hence it is, that life must not be counted dear, when to be
faithful to religion would endanger it.&nbsp; Hence it is, that
not only <i>directly</i> spiritual acts are to be frequent, and
spiritual offerings to be many and large, but that everything we
have is to be held for religion, and everything we do, to be done
for religion; our daily tasks, our rest and labour, our very
eating and drinking.&nbsp; Christ has purchased us entirely soul
and body, talents and possessions, to glorify Him by perpetually
offering to Him the sacrifice of love; and there is no love in
that offering which is formal, indolent, unwilling, self-saving;
which is restrained from thought, and effort, and hazard, and
bountifulness, by the consideration, how much it will cost.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not offer unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
my <span class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; and the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> my <span class="smcap">God</span> will
not accept &ldquo;of that which doth cost me
nothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>This
is the principle and measure of Christian offering to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Would we offer affection? it must
be all affection.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Son, give me Thy
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Submission?&nbsp; Deny Thyself in all
things.&nbsp; Time?&nbsp; Let it be all time&mdash;instant,
continual, day and night.&nbsp; Substance?&nbsp; Be ready to part
with all that thou hast.&nbsp; Work?&nbsp; It must be all work;
every labour, and every occupation.&nbsp; Whatsoever thou doest,
do all to the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> in all things may be glorified through
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.&nbsp; We, and all that
we are and have, are claimed as whole sacrifices to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; The duration of the offering is
to be the length of our life.&nbsp; The altars upon which we are
to be offered, are all the places and all the circumstances in
which <span class="smcap">God</span> puts us, or we put
ourselves; and we are to be continually laying ourselves upon
these altars, without fear or grudging of the cost, yea, rather
with cheerful incurring of it.</p>
<p>It is a great and difficult service.&nbsp; The very best of
our fallen race, the Abrahams and the Pauls, who have most
realised this service, and loved it, and laid themselves out to
render it, have yet fallen short, very far short of the perfect
offering.&nbsp; Many a time have they reluctantly laid the costly
sacrifice on the altar; many a time, alas! have they substituted
the lame, the halt, the lean, the blemished, for the firstling of
the flock; many a due sacred journey has not been undertaken;
many a holy service has been unperformed, or performed amiss;
many an altar has been bare, without an offering.&nbsp; Yes, the
most godly, the <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>saints that excel, have fallen far short of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> standard, and have withheld or
offered amiss what <span class="smcap">God</span> required.&nbsp;
But yet through infirmity, not through wilfulness or selfishness,
have they done it, and speedily and deeply have they repented of
it, and then have they straightway laid upon the nearest altar
the sacrifice of a broken and a contrite heart, in whose
fragrance the ill savour of the other has been lost, with whose
costliness <span class="smcap">God</span> has been well
pleased.&nbsp; Such a sacrifice He never despises.&nbsp; Those
who offer it shall be forgiven all that is past.&nbsp; They shall
be dealt with by the after, not the former life.&nbsp; But, my
brethren, if such as these fall short of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> standard, what of us, who, alas!
can lay no claim to attempted perfection, or to grief and
contrition for shortcomings?&nbsp; What of our service of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; What do <i>we</i> offer
Him?&nbsp; What does religion cost us?</p>
<p>It should cost us much thought&mdash;more thought than
anything else.&nbsp; Does it?&nbsp; Is it the most frequent and
most encouraged employment of our minds to meditate on <span
class="smcap">God</span>, our Creator and Preserver, our
Redeemer, our Sanctifier, our Lord and Judge, on heaven, on
holiness, on trial and reward, duties and hopes?&nbsp; We all of
us have some favourite subject of thought and meditation,
something which we ponder chiefly, and lay most plans about, and
zealously occupy our mental faculties upon.&nbsp; Is it
religion?&nbsp; Does that cost us more thought than anything
else? or does business or pleasure, or politics or philosophy, or
worldly prospects or <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>cares?&nbsp; If so&mdash;no matter
how innocent the object, how laudable in some respects its
concern&mdash;in making it a chief consideration, we leave nought
to offer <span class="smcap">God</span> but that which costs us
nothing, and which is therefore nothing accounted of, yea, rather
is rejected by Him.</p>
<p>Again, religion should cost us much affection.&nbsp; Our
affections should be chiefly set on it, and only on other things
when they can be lawfully considered the adjuncts of
religion.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; Do we love <span
class="smcap">God</span> more than anything else?&nbsp; Do we
desire heaven&rsquo;s treasures more than earth&rsquo;s; eternal
glories more than temporal?&nbsp; Do we delight above all things
in spiritual pursuits?&nbsp; If any other person, any other thing
presents itself as a candidate for our best affections, is it
rejected because the place is already filled?&nbsp; Is it
disliked, if opposed to religion?&nbsp; Is it but moderately
esteemed and distantly entertained, when though not opposed to
it, is not religion itself?&nbsp; If otherwise, then religion
costs us not our best affections, and so of our hearts we offer
unto <span class="smcap">God</span> of that which doth cost us
nothing.</p>
<p>Again, religion should cost us much labour, much self-denial,
much zeal and patience, more than anything else.&nbsp; Does
it?&nbsp; Is there nothing for which we toil more, and endure
more, and encounter more; nothing which we pursue more constantly
and zealously?&nbsp; Do we take more pains to please <span
class="smcap">God</span> than man?&nbsp; Do we make more
strenuous endeavours to become good Christians than to become <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>apt
scholars, profound philosophers, able and respected politicians,
successful tradesmen, accomplished members of society?&nbsp;
Would we, and do we rather rise early, and late take rest, go
without our usual meals, undertake fatiguing journeys, contend
with difficulties, suffer reproaches for religion than for
anything else?&nbsp; Do we bear the inconvenience of a warm
church more cheerfully than that of a close shop, a crowded hall
of business or pleasure?&nbsp; Do we venture forth on religious
errands, in cold, and wet, and forbidding weather, more readily
than we do for anything else?&nbsp; In what do we wear out our
strength and energies, run our greatest risks, and consume our
time?&nbsp; Is it, directly or indirectly, in religion; or is it
in business or in pleasure?&nbsp; For what do we renounce all
needless occupations, for what do we get through as speedily as
may be our necessary work?&nbsp; Is it to have time and strength
for religion, or for what?&nbsp; The answer, my brethren, which
your consciences honestly give to these questions, and many like
them that might be asked, will help to determine what religion
costs you in this respect, and whether or no, you offer unto
<span class="smcap">God</span> only of that which doth cost you
nothing.</p>
<p>Again, religion should cost much of our substance.&nbsp; In
one sense, it should cost us all our substance, <i>i.e.</i> we
should never spend one mite on a sinful or doubtful pleasure or
business, or in contributing to an unhallowed end.&nbsp; Much,
indeed, we must lay out in the sustenance of our natural <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>life, in
the prosecution of our worldly calling, in the support and
advancement of our families, in the maintenance of our social
position.&nbsp; Something, too, we are allowed to spend on our
innocent recreations and those of others.&nbsp; But that which is
to cost us most, on which we are to spend all that we can, and to
yearn to be able to spend more, is on <span
class="smcap">God</span>; directly, by spreading the knowledge of
His name, by promoting His service, by building fit temples for
His worship, and adorning them suitably to our devotion and His
glory; indirectly, by ministering to His representatives, the
poor, and afflicted, and helpless, and ignorant.</p>
<p>What, my brethren, let me ask in all plainness, for I speak
for <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> representatives&mdash;the
poor&mdash;what does religion cost you in this respect?&nbsp; Are
you sure that you have left no Lazaruses to perish of hunger? no
pining sick to die for want of the nutriment or attention which
you could have afforded? no children to grow up in ignorance and
blasphemy whom you could have maintained at school, and helped to
make enlightened, serious, holy men and women?&nbsp; Have you
looked to these things, yourselves? or have you ungrudgingly,
liberally supported those who do?&nbsp; Have you ascertained that
the sick and visiting funds of your parish are able to meet the
many demands upon them? that there is no difficulty in
maintaining the necessary staff of the poor&rsquo;s best
guardians, the clergy? that the alms-boxes will hold no more, or
that there is no demand on their <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>contents?&nbsp; Have you done all
this before you have laden your tables with rich viands and
costly wines, and bought expensive toys and ornaments, and gone
on unnecessary excursions, and paid much for amusements?&nbsp; Or
have you consulted self first, and fed, and decked, and petted,
and amused self, and then been ready (not, perhaps, even then,
<i>forward</i>, but waiting to be asked) to give up something of
what self could conveniently spare, for crying, grievous
necessities&mdash;sparing <span class="smcap">God</span> your
leavings, that which you did not want, or, at least, could easily
do without?&nbsp; Remember, brethren, I lay no charge against any
one of you.&nbsp; I only, in faithfulness, put to you plain
questions, which it is your duty to consider; and bid you
speedily discover, from their consideration, what your religion
costs you; whether, in your succour, temporal and spiritual, of
those worse off than yourselves, you deny and inconvenience
yourselves, giving what you cannot part with without feeling its
loss and curtailing from other things on account of it (as you
all ought to do); or whether you offer unto <span
class="smcap">God</span>, in this way, of that which doth cost
you nothing.</p>
<p>Once more, religion should cost you much in the direct service
of <span class="smcap">God</span>; in providing amply for His
wide and becoming worship.&nbsp; I pass by now, as duties which
there are other opportunities of enforcing, the maintenance of
missions, at home and abroad; the building and endowing of
schools and churches, and many like things, that I may dwell <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>for a few
moments upon the costliness of the materials of our churches, and
their furniture, and, let me add, their ornaments; for all which,
if I understand the Bible, we Christians are bound to
provide.&nbsp; In the descriptions given us in the Bible, of
heaven and heavenly things, there is frequent mention and great
display, as it were, of gold, and precious stones, and musical
instruments, and beautiful robes, and the like.&nbsp; There are
some who understand these descriptions literally, and who suppose
that, being raised in material, though glorified bodies, the
redeemed will inhabit a material heaven&mdash;either this earth
transformed, or some other planet&mdash;and will be surrounded
with glorious material objects, the most beautiful and precious
of nature&rsquo;s productions, fashioned like to art&rsquo;s best
accomplishments.&nbsp; If this is to be so, then it is urged,
earth&rsquo;s tabernacles, as the type of heaven, should be as
nearly assimilated to heaven as possible; we should improve and
furnish our plainer and barer churches as much as we can; we
should build our new churches in the best, the handsomest style
of art; and decorate and furnish them in the most substantially
costly manner.</p>
<p>Without subscribing to this view (though there is really much
to be said for it), I would humbly suggest that, since <span
class="smcap">God</span>, when He designed an earthly tabernacle,
prescribed that it, and all in it, should be costly and
ornamental; and that when He speaks of heaven He does so under
the image of all that is accounted splendid and costly on <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>earth, He
either must have meant to require that we should erect and adorn
our churches after this description, or He must have taken for
granted that we should best understand spiritual beauties and
excellencies by their comparison with what we account earthly
beauties and excellencies, and that we should naturally honour
and worship Him with the best of these within our reach.&nbsp; It
seems, then, to be our duty, nay, to be natural to us, if we are
in earnest, whichever view we take, to make our churches and
their contents beauteous and costly, either as images of the
future church in heaven, or as the nearest representations to it
which we can furnish, and the best copies of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> own pattern.</p>
<p>To this it has been objected, firstly, that the primitive
Christians afford us no such example; and, secondly, that it
seems unfitting, trifling, unseemly, to decorate the spiritual
palace as we would an earthly mansion.&nbsp; The first objection
falls to the ground, when we remember, that the early Christians
were very poor, and, moreover, were obliged to hide themselves,
and, therefore, to refrain from all that would attract attention;
and that, as soon as they had the means and liberty, they made
their churches very splendid, and furnished them very
gorgeously.&nbsp; And the second objection is as soon disposed
of.&nbsp; What is unfitting, trifling, unseemly, for the Master,
is surely as much, and more so, for the disciple.&nbsp; If <span
class="smcap">God</span> is to dwell in tents, we ought not to
dwell in ceiled houses; if gold, and precious stones, and
beautiful <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>arts are unfit for Him, then they are pre-eminently
unfit for us.&nbsp; If we may not furnish His house with rich
furniture, and put into it, for instance, the best musical
instrument, we must not do so in our own houses.&nbsp; It is
enough for us, that we should be as our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; We must not be above Him, or
different from Him.&nbsp; We must not glory in what is unfit for
Him.&nbsp; Be then our own abodes rude; let everything in them be
homely, unadorned, inferior; banish from them all traces of the
artist&rsquo;s skill; or give all, and use all, more exceedingly
upon and in the house of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>One more argument for adorning and furnishing to the utmost,
the house of <span class="smcap">God</span>:&mdash;We must not
offer unto <span class="smcap">God</span> of that which doth cost
us nothing of our substance.&nbsp; Now, all that we offer
indirectly, no matter how much, how frequently, may yet cost us
nothing&mdash;that is, it may be only the laying out of that for
which we get an immediate equivalent.&nbsp; When you relieve the
sick, rescue the tempted, raise the fallen, by the contribution
of your substance, if you have not the reward of their gratitude,
there is at least the felt human satisfaction of the act; and
that would and has remunerated many an infidel.&nbsp; The
sacrifice, therefore, in this case, ceases to be a sacrifice; it
is a laying out for those who pay you again.&nbsp; But when you
expend your substance largely on the direct service of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, hoping for nothing again, perhaps
getting nothing, then you offer of that which costs you
something; something for which you do not expect an
equivalent.&nbsp; <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>The exercise is a good one, and the duty is
imperative.&nbsp; If you got your money&rsquo;s worth, and your
human satisfaction, for its outlay, then you would be offering to
<span class="smcap">God</span> of that which doth cost you
nothing.</p>
<p>Let this consideration urge you, then, first, indeed to
provide what is <i>necessary</i> for the service of <span
class="smcap">God</span> by yourselves; afterwards, what may help
others in like manner to serve Him; and then, not by mulcting
them, but by denying yourselves, to give some true gift, some
free-will offering, which is costly in itself, and promises no
present equivalent.&nbsp; Thus shall you overcome selfish and
mere human feelings, and render dutiful, and grateful, and costly
sacrifice unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>My brethren, depart not with the notion that you have heard
nothing of Christ this morning.&nbsp; It is a deep-rooted error
that, under the law men were commanded to do, but under the
Gospel they are forbidden; that <i>then</i> salvation was a work,
but <i>now</i> it is only a contemplation.&nbsp; The contrary is
the truth.&nbsp; Men might contemplate and wait idly and dreamily
before their Redeemer came; they must be up and doing now that He
has laid His hand upon them, and given them a lifelong, arduous,
self-sacrificing work to do.</p>
<p>It is because Christ has purchased you wholly, body, and soul,
and spirit, thoughts, words, and deeds, talents and substance, to
be an entire and constant sacrifice unto Him; it is because He is
watching over you, and working for and in you, <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>to make you
that sacrifice; it is because presently He will judge and deal
with you, according as you have been, or have not been what He
required, that I have enforced on you the pre-eminently Christian
lesson of taking solemn, anxious heed, that you offer not unto
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> your <span
class="smcap">God</span> of that which doth cost you nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> have apprehended; to have

gone through the Christian&rsquo;s appointed course of discipline
and duties; to have acquired the acceptable and approved

shaken off&mdash;this even Paul did not claim to have done.&nbsp;
Divinely enlightened as he was, greatly zealous, blamelessly
righteous, the chosen vessel of the <span

<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Brethren, if Paul, with all his light, all his labours,
all his holiness, all his love, felt that heaven, was, after all,
not his sure inheritance, how can any among us count themselves
to have secured it, to have become perfect?&nbsp; And yet, not a
few do!&nbsp; I am not alluding now to those who are called
Calvinists, to those who believe that salvation will infallibly
be conferred on a few, chosen without regard to their former, or
care for their after life; and that they who believe this
doctrine are certainly of the chosen few (every Calvinist,
according to his own creed, is sure of salvation)&mdash;to those
who fancy that a peculiar flutter of strange feelings in the
breast which they felt at a certain moment of some day or night,
perhaps long past, was the impression of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> seal upon them; a seal which
cannot be broken, which has marked them <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> for ever; and that all they have
to do in anticipation, in preparation for glory, is to talk and
think about man&rsquo;s depravity, and <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> electing grace.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
I am alluding to such as are most of you, brethren; who have
probably never concerned yourselves about supposed absolute
decrees, and irresistible grace, and final perseverance; who do
not claim to be objects of any signal conversion; who have felt,
and feel no ecstacy and rapture which betoken sure acceptance;
and of you, I say, that many of you count yourselves to have
apprehended, to know as much, to have done as much, to feel as
much, to be as perfect, as you need, and to have a sure hope of
salvation.&nbsp; None <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>of you have a definite theory of
this kind; none of you, if I took you apart and said, &ldquo;Are
you sure of heaven?&rdquo; would dare to answer,
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; or to feel that you might answer,
&ldquo;yes;&rdquo; but many of you, nevertheless, do persuade
yourselves, that it is even so; many of you so spend your lives
as though you had already apprehended, as though there were
nothing which you had yet to attain.</p>
<p>Listen!&nbsp; You believe that there is another life after
this.&nbsp; You believe that it may be one of glory, or one of
shame and destruction.&nbsp; You believe that there are necessary
qualifications for glory, without which it will not be
conferred.&nbsp; You hope and expect to partake of the
glory.&nbsp; You all know that the change from this life to the
next may come at any moment, to any one of you.&nbsp; Still, the
greater part of you make no effort to prepare farther for that
change; but go on, day after day, year after year, doing the same
deeds, thinking the same thoughts, feeling the same feelings, in
the same way and measure as heretofore.&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp;
And if it is, do you not justify yourselves&mdash;do you not at
least compose yourselves in your present state&mdash;by
asserting, or at any rate by not actively denying, that you have
attained as much faith, and holiness and love, as you need to fit
you for heaven.&nbsp; You have apprehended: at least you think
so.&nbsp; Otherwise, how could you be contented?&nbsp; Believing
in your heart of hearts that there is a heaven, how could you be
satisfied if you did not think you would go to it; if you
conceived <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>it possible that the want of something which you have
not yet, might shut you out from glory?&nbsp; As I speak to you
thus, you feel disposed to protest against my words.&nbsp; You
know you are not perfect.&nbsp; You frequently sigh over your
lamentable imperfections.&nbsp; You feel that it is only
unspeakable mercy which can make any allowance for you.&nbsp; You
are not fit for heaven.&nbsp; You are not satisfied with
yourselves.&nbsp; You have not attained.&nbsp; You have much to
do.&nbsp; You intend to do much.&nbsp; Yes! this is your protest,
and it is an honest one; you mean it, you feel it.&nbsp; But,
brethren, I am not talking of what you mean and feel <i>now</i>;
of the momentary stir of right feeling which takes place
occasionally, in church when the minister of Christ rouses you;
or at home or abroad, when <span class="smcap">God</span> calls
loudly to you by some unusual act of Providence; or on a sick
bed, when physicians speak doubtfully, and friends wear ominously
troubled looks; or at the grave-side, when one of your own age
and circumstances of life, and like constitution, is being hidden
out of sight.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I am speaking of your usual
feelings, and your every-day life; and I say, on their clear
testimony, that many of you count yourselves to have
apprehended.</p>
<p>You are at ease about heaven; you do not strive, you do not
press forward as though it were yet to gain; you do not imagine
that any striving, any pressing forward, is needed.&nbsp; What
are the religious exercises of the many?&nbsp; A few words of
private prayer, morning and evening; an attendance <i>once</i> on
the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> day at church; and <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>now and
then, perhaps, a participation of the holy communion.&nbsp; These
are the chief, often the only, efforts for grace to attain and
apprehend.&nbsp; No perpetual upraising of the soul in prayer; no
delight in public worship; no frequent yearning for the
communication of Christ through His appointed ordinances; no
eager searching of His Word for light, and guidance, and comfort,
and encouragement!&nbsp; What, again, are the strivings of the
many to attain a heavenly character; to do the work which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given them to do; to put aside the
old man, with his affections and lusts; to walk in holy
obedience?&nbsp; Alas! they are merely negative; forbearing to
offend against the letter of the great commandments.&nbsp; No
literal idolatry, no profane swearing, no Sabbath-breaking, no
stealing, no deed of lust, no deliberate slander.&nbsp; This is
their righteousness; and if, besides, they occasionally sigh, or
utter a self-condemnation, on account of the frequently
reiterated, uncurbed outbreaks and indulgences of what they call
&ldquo;infirmities,&rdquo; they seem to themselves to have
attained to exemplary excellence.&nbsp; No matter that all their
usual feelings are earth-born, and earth-directed; that their
affections are set on worldly things; that they continue, year
after year, every whit as spiritually indolent, impatient,
bad-tempered, sensual in thought, jealous, faithless, unloving,
unholy.&nbsp; They might, indeed, be better in these respects;
perhaps they ought to be; but it is not actually necessary.&nbsp;
They have already attained what is absolutely <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>needed.&nbsp; If not quite perfect (no man is) they are
perfect enough; better than many others; as good as <span
class="smcap">God</span> will require.</p>
<p>Oh, if men do not <i>think</i> this, do they not <i>act</i> it
and testify it in their lives?&nbsp; Does not their religion seem
to be a mere occasional pastime? something to be taken up only in
the intervals of life&rsquo;s earnest work; a matter of no real
moment; which does not demand more than ceremonious observance,
leaving the thoughts, the affections, the energy free; offering
nothing (worth the while) to be pursued with zeal, and industry,
and self-denial; to progress and grow perfect in; having no
claims upon us which are not sufficiently discharged in the way
of mere routine?</p>
<p>I should wrong many of you, dear brethren, if I meant this
charge to be universal.&nbsp; Of not a few of you, &ldquo;we are
persuaded better things, and things that accompany salvation,
though we thus speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, in a degree, even
<i>you</i> answer to this description, or part of it; coming
nearer, now and then, to contentment about your spiritual state
than you should; forbearing, frequently, to press forward enough
for what is not yet attained.</p>
<p>Well, then, we are all reproved by the apostle&rsquo;s lowly
estimation of his own past and present: &ldquo;I count not myself
to have apprehended.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us now seek to be
instructed by his proposals for the future: &ldquo;Forgetting the
things that are behind, I reach forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; First, then,
we are to forget the things that are behind.&nbsp; In the figure
which the <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>apostle uses, that of a runner in a race, to forget
what is behind is, not to pride ourselves upon, not to think of
the progress we have already made.&nbsp; Paradox though it seem,
the Christian religion often bids us both remember and forget the
same thing; and it does so in this case.&nbsp; We are to remember
the success which has attended us hitherto in the attempt to
serve <span class="smcap">God</span>, both to prompt our
gratitude for the past, and to encourage us to persevere, as
having hope that we may prevail.&nbsp; We are to forget it, so as
not to presume on our goodness; not to rest satisfied with aught
we have done, or to count ourselves as having in any measure
attained to what <span class="smcap">God</span> requires of
us.&nbsp; There is much temptation to such self-satisfaction, and
there is much danger in it.&nbsp; Few, if any of us, who have
been earnestly endeavouring to work out our salvation, can fail
to observe that we have accomplished something.&nbsp; We have
come to feel an interest in spiritual things.&nbsp; Prayer,
instead of being altogether a wearisome task, or a mere matter of
routine, has begun to be an enjoyable exercise.&nbsp; The pursuit
of godliness, instead of being altogether a hard task, requiring
us to forego all that is pleasant, to encounter much that is
trying, to do that for which we have no taste, has begun to
bestow on us its reward, in fulfilling its promise of making glad
the life that now is, in elevating us, though, perhaps, but
little, towards the hope of the life which is to come.&nbsp; We
like now (that is, we dislike less) the exercises of
devotion.&nbsp; We <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>more readily give up what once we clung to as the
chiefest good.&nbsp; We begin to realise, that there is something
worth striving for beyond; and we make efforts, though they may
be feeble, to reach it, and lay hold on it.&nbsp; But, perceiving
this change, this improvement in ourselves, we run the risk of
coming to think, that we are not like other men; that we have
come out, and are separate; that we are in the right way; that
<span class="smcap">God</span> approves us.&nbsp; And the natural
effect of this perception, or rather the effect which Satan
causes it to produce, is spiritual pride and spiritual
indolence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love prayer, I cultivate holiness: what
lack I yet?&nbsp; I have attained; I have apprehended Christ;
knowing and loving Him, and laying fast hold on His
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a feeling once harboured in the breast, and thus
interpreted, soon begins to deaden our spiritual energies.&nbsp;
We cease to be holy as soon as we fancy ourselves holy.&nbsp; We
relinquish effort as soon as we find that we have been using
it.&nbsp; In the remembrance of the past, in the spiritual pride
which it produces, we forget the future and unlearn
humility.&nbsp; Therefore we are to forget the past of
progress.</p>
<p>But, besides this, we are to forget what is behind of failure
and trial, and former superiority.&nbsp; There is nothing so apt
to beget despondency, to discourage further effort, as the review
of unsuccess: &ldquo;I have tried this before, and failed; it is
of no use to try it again.&nbsp; Destiny, or innate corruption
seems to thwart me and bind me down; it is vain to contend
against it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it is that <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>men
persuade themselves to yield unresistingly to evil.&nbsp; When
bidden to forsake it, when desiring to forsake it, instead of
making the effort as though it were a first one, the beginning of
a right course, in which, if they persevere, they may hope by
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace to do well, they
recall to memory how they have failed before, and persuade
themselves, from their remembrance, that in like manner they
should surely fail again: and so they refuse to try.&nbsp; And
so, too, the remembrance of former superiority discourages.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How pure, how temperate, how steady, how comparatively
good was I once.&nbsp; Alas! that cannot be again.&nbsp; I cannot
undo what I have done.&nbsp; I cannot recover what is lost.&nbsp;
The past can never be the present.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, it cannot,
brethren, and therefore forget it.&nbsp; Do not seek to undo, to
recover.&nbsp; Since that cannot be, aim at something else; and,
that you may aim the more steadily, do not let your eye wander
elsewhere.&nbsp; If you have left your father&rsquo;s house, and
wasted your substance in riotous living, it is too late to
prevent you from being a prodigal; but it is not too late to
become a returning prodigal.&nbsp; Forget your former
independence; forget the going away into the far country.&nbsp;
Remember, that your Father still lives; that He is a merciful, a
pardoning Father; that His arms are spread out to enfold you;
that there is still room, and welcome room, for you in His
house.&nbsp; Forget what you have abandoned, and seek what you
may yet have: not former innocence, not the inheritance of
uninterrupted dutifulness, but reformed <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>life, and
fresh favour, a new place as a new character.</p>
<p>Once more, forget the things that are behind, as you start, as
you run along the course from the world to heaven.&nbsp; Do not
delay in considering what you have to give up; do not grudge the
effort; do not turn aside your eyes to behold what you are
leaving behind, what you are passing by the way.&nbsp; Temporal
things, though so infinitely inferior to eternal, are near and
palpable; while the spiritual are distant and indistinctly
seen.&nbsp; If you ponder and weigh, if you count over too
frequently the cost, your own carnal judgment, and Satan&rsquo;s
blinding influence, will check you at starting, or lure you
aside.&nbsp; To look back, to gaze about you, to stand still for
a moment, is perhaps to lose the race.&nbsp; &ldquo;See,&rdquo;
says Satan, &ldquo;what you are leaving, what you are
passing.&nbsp; Here are riches, honour, friends, pleasure,
ease.&rdquo;&nbsp; You look, and the look leads you back, or
makes you stumble, perhaps fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Onward,
onward!&rdquo; be this your cry; this your aim.&nbsp; Stay not in
all the plain; look not behind you; look on; behold the goal;
remember the prize.&nbsp; Think not of the past; regard not the
present; aim at the future.&nbsp; Forgetting the things that are
behind, reach forth unto those that are before.</p>
<p>I have anticipated the other lesson of wisdom; that of
reaching forth; of concentrating all your thoughts, and all your
energies, on what is held out to you by <span
class="smcap">God</span> in Christ.&nbsp; You are not to measure
<a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>the
distance you have come; you are not to brood over stumblings, and
falls, and past slowness; you are not to recall the things that
you have left, nor to look at those you are passing.&nbsp; You
are to run on, as if the race were all before you; as if the
course were an untrodden one; as if there were good hope of
reaching the goal.&nbsp; And you are to look steadfastly at the
goal, and run eagerly towards it.&nbsp; This is your position;
this your course; these your hopes.</p>
<p>Gird up your loins then, lay aside every weight, the weight of
worldly temptation, the weight of experienced failure, the weight
of difficulties and troubles.&nbsp; Assured that the race may be
run, assay to run it.&nbsp; Knowing that the prize is still
proffered, attempt to gain it.&nbsp; Gather experience from the
past, what to do, what to avoid.&nbsp; Redouble your efforts,
quicken your pace, because the time is short, and much of it has
been trifled away.&nbsp; Take hope from the future, because the
lists are still open, because you are accepted candidates for the
prize, because the king waits to crown you.</p>
<p>What does all this mean in plain language?&nbsp; Sinners!
repent, cry for mercy, pray for grace, aim at godliness.&nbsp;
Lovers of the world! unloose your affections from what is
worthless and perishable; fix them upon what is above value and
everlasting; let go what you have, cast it behind you, and seek
what you have not.&nbsp; Loiterers! move on.&nbsp; Crawlers! rise
upon your feet and run.&nbsp; There is no time for delay, for
tardy pace.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> waits to
crown <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>you, but He will not wait long.&nbsp; Racers! race on,
faster, more intent.&nbsp; Let your desires outstrip your
feet.&nbsp; Quicken your feet, to come up to your desires.&nbsp;
But a little, and the trial of your speed will be over, and the
conquerors will be crowned, and all others be rejected.</p>
<p>Brethren, one and all, consider the prize of your high calling
of <span class="smcap">God</span> in Christ <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&nbsp; Enlist heartily in its pursuit;
shake off everything that hinders; shut your eyes against all
that allures; seek guidance, strength, and perseverance, in
prayer, study of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word, and
other holy ordinances.&nbsp; Use those graces in daily instant
increasing efforts; animate yourselves more and more by
anticipations of what is held out, by nearer and more constant
beholding of it.&nbsp; Stay not, and pause not till the arms of
acceptance enfold you, the Voice of approval greets you,
&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; and grateful, realised joy enables you
to exclaim, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I have finished
my course, henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

SPIRITUAL THINGS NOT REVEALED TO THE NATURAL MAN.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">Corinthians</span>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>.,
14.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of <span class="smcap">God</span>: for they are foolishness unto
him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of you, my brethren, to some
extent profess, and to some extent desire, to be religious.&nbsp;
All of you assent to the truth, that religion is the &ldquo;one
thing needful,&rdquo; and yet many of you, if you knew your
hearts, and examined your ways, would be constrained to admit
that religion is not the ruling power of your life.&nbsp; You are
indeed religious according to the standard of the age,
<i>i.e.</i>, you come to church on Sunday, perhaps occasionally
to holy communion, you say your prayers morning and evening, you
read the Bible now and then, you do not grossly offend against
any one of the ten commandments, you sigh over your frailties and
infirmities, you give <i>something</i> to the poor.&nbsp; All
this entitles you, in the estimation of others, to be classed
among what are called religious people; and suggests to
yourselves the comfortable <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>thought, that, at least, you are not
worse than other men; that, in fact, you are much better than
many.&nbsp; Still, if you are careful readers of your Bible, if
you are observant of the world within and around you, if you are
given to self-searching, you must often feel that your religion
is but a sorry counterfeit of what <span class="smcap">God</span>
has taught and saints have reflected; that you are scarcely half
in earnest about it; that you experience very little advantage
from it; that you render very empty homage to it.&nbsp; For
instance, you read the Sermon on the Mount, or the reiteration of
many parts of it here and there, in the epistles; you put
together the several characteristics of true religion there
displayed; and then, turning an eye upon yourselves, looking back
upon the path you have trodden, surveying the ground upon which
you now stand, testing your practice, scanning your motives,
asking yourselves, &ldquo;By what am I mainly influenced? whither
tend my chief desires? what are my feelings?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; you exclaim, &ldquo;where, in all these, are
the influences and operations of the religion taught by Christ
and His apostles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, again, you read of Joseph, stoutly refusing the safe
indulgence of a forbidden pleasure, under a heartfelt conviction
of required sanctity, and present accountability, which found its
vent in those memorable words, &ldquo;How can I do this great
wickedness and sin against <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then you find him,
after shining thus brilliantly as a saint, patiently, religiously
bearing the treatment of a <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>sinner.&nbsp; Or you read of
Abraham, giving up at a word&rsquo;s bidding the comforts of
home, the ties of kindred, and the means of support; wandering
henceforth throughout his life in a strange land, apparently
coming no nearer to the promised rest and blessedness, yet
cheerfully, hopefully, thankfully, admitting and feeling that all
was, and would be right and well for him.&nbsp; Or you read of
Moses, refusing the honours, the pleasures, the riches of a court
life, and choosing to be a wanderer, to endure all kinds of
hardships and reproaches, that he might avoid sin and serve <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Or you read of Job, subjected to
concentrated miseries and undeserved chastisements and rebukes,
and blessing the Hand which had imposed them, or at least had not
interfered to ward them off.&nbsp; Or you read of David, weeping
over a forgiven sin, setting it always before him, making
frequent mention of it in his prayers, accepting often reverses
as the due chastisement of it, and thanking <span
class="smcap">God</span> for them.&nbsp; Or you read of Stephen,
cruelly maligned, savagely beaten to death, and yet spending his
dying breath, not in protesting, not in invoking vengeance, but
in praying, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, lay not this
sin to their charge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, once more, you read of
Paul, testifying that to die is gain, and, in the least adverse
circumstances of his converted life, coveting to depart.</p>
<p>You read, I say, of these things; you consider under what
feelings and hopes they were borne and encountered, and you sadly
exclaim, &ldquo;Where, in me, in deed or feeling, in aim or
restraint, in perseverance <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>or patience, is the religion of
Joseph, of Abraham, of Moses, of Job, of David, of Stephen, of
Paul?&nbsp; Do I thus resist temptations to unlawful
pleasures?&nbsp; Do I set loose my natural affections, give up my
worldly goods, go forth into unknown and unguessed-at
circumstances at Divine bidding?&nbsp; Do I refuse proffered
honours, riches, pleasures, not because they are in themselves
sinful, but because they <i>may</i> possibly lead me into
sin?&nbsp; Do I patiently and thankfully endure even merited
chastisements?&nbsp; Do I struggle with myself and with <span
class="smcap">God</span> to prevent past sins from escaping out
of my remembrance?&nbsp; Do I seek to bless those who revile or
injure me?&nbsp; Do I feel that to die is gain; and do I covet to
depart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If not, why not?&nbsp; It is so that <span
class="smcap">God</span> willed men to do; it is so they have in
many cases done; and it is so that many still do.&nbsp; Yes,
there are still such saints; men and women who steadfastly resist
wrong pleasures, under the heart-conviction of required sanctity,
and of accountability to a present <span
class="smcap">God</span>; who give up, even while they hold them,
all worldly possessions, and go forth, in feeling, in desire, in
deed if need be, without distrust, with happy, thankful,
confidence, when and whithersoever <span class="smcap">God</span>
bids them; who forego proffered advantages, and content
themselves with a low seat when they might, perhaps, have the
highest, because it is <i>safer</i> for them as servants of <span
class="smcap">God</span>; who weep and abhor themselves, and
desire to be chastened for their sins; who love to do good to
their enemies; <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>who holily yearn to die.&nbsp; There are men and women
who do make religion the one thing needful; who hold themselves
in check by its restraints; who urge themselves on by its
promises; who bask in its sunshine, and reflect its glorious
image in their lives.&nbsp; There are men and women whose
business is religion; who kneel long and often in prayer; who
meditate day and night on the Bible; whose hearts ever leap to
<span class="smcap">God</span>; who grieve to forego an
opportunity of holy communion; who never stop away from church
because there are only prayers, or because their favourite
preacher will not be in the pulpit, or because it is hot or
cold.&nbsp; Good citizens they are, attentive to their callings,
provident parents, dutiful children, affectionate husbands and
wives, cheerful companions, most useful in their generation, and
yet truly religious, bent upon religion; regarding this life as
an apprenticeship to it, and striving so to use their
apprenticeship as to be perfect in their calling, ere they are
summoned to exercise it (their ardent expectation) as partners
with angels, and patriarchs, and apostles, and perfected saints,
under the rule of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Glory,
in the city of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>My brethren, if <span class="smcap">God</span> has prescribed
such religion as this; if saints of old, ay, and men and women of
our own times too, have been thus religious; it must be
important, and, I would fain hope, acceptable, for you who
profess and desire to be religious, but are not, to learn wherein
you differ, why you fail.&nbsp; The text tells you: &ldquo;The <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>: for they are foolishness unto him:
neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The things of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo; (the matters, that is, of
revelation) are foolishness to the natural man, and he cannot
know or appreciate them.&nbsp; My brethren, are the things of the
Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span> ever regarded by you as
foolishness?&nbsp; Start not, nor be offended at the
question.&nbsp; You would, doubtless, deem it very blasphemy to
say, &ldquo;it is folly,&rdquo; of anything <span
class="smcap">God</span> has revealed.&nbsp; You would rush from
the bare thought.&nbsp; Still, you may practically allow what you
thus shudder at when exhibited in its plainness.&nbsp; Let us
see.&nbsp; Do you ever deliberately do what religion
forbids?&nbsp; Do you ever deliberately omit what religion
requires?&nbsp; Do you never weigh the things of the world
against the things of the Spirit, and then choose the
former?&nbsp; Do you never prefer pleasure to duty? staying away
from church, or curtailing your religious worship, to take your
leisure, to enjoy a friend&rsquo;s company, to go for a pleasant
walk, to read an interesting book, to see some unusual sight, to
frequent some place of secular entertainment, to forward some
worldly end?&nbsp; Do you not, at least, excuse yourselves from
acts of religion, by pleas that you would not admit in these
other cases?&nbsp; Do you not find time for earthly things, that
you do not find for spiritual?&nbsp; Do you not make exertions
for worldly ends, that you do not make for heavenly?&nbsp; Do you
not curb, and restrain, and deny yourselves, in the one case, and
use no such discipline <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>in the other?&nbsp; Well, of course
you do this through some appreciation of the thing sought;
because it interests you, is pleasant, or expedient, or
profitable.&nbsp; You do not deliberately choose
&ldquo;folly,&rdquo; you pursue it as the wise course,
<i>i.e.</i>, you treat the opposite as though it were unwise, not
realising it to be wisdom, you put it aside as foolishness.&nbsp;
Then, again, of restraints, and sanctions, and hopes.&nbsp; Would
you not forbear to do in the presence of a fellow-being what you
unhesitatingly do under the eye of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Do you not fear a parent, a
husband, a wife, a master, a friend, a customer, more than <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Does the thought of eternal
punishment concern you as much as the prospect of chastisement at
the hand of man? of failure in business? of serious illness? of
bodily disfigurement?&nbsp; Do you act chiefly with regard to the
praise of <span class="smcap">God</span>, or the admiration of
your fellow-beings?&nbsp; Do you <i>feast</i> on the expectation
of heaven, or on that of some worldly joy or honour?&nbsp; Do you
like, above all things, the thought of dwelling for ever where
there will be no money-getting, no earthly indulgences, no
flattery, no vain glory, no frivolity, no unseemliness, no rest
from the praising of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the
company of saints?&nbsp; If a message came to you now, that
within an hour you should be removed to paradise, would you not
shrink from the announcement? would you not cling to earth? would
you not wish your removal to be deferred?&nbsp; Then do you not
appreciate something more than the things of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Do not your desires, and hopes, and
fears, deal with them as though they were comparatively
foolishness?</p>
<p>Remember, brethren, I am not now inveighing against sin; I am
not attempting to make a catalogue of your offences, that I may
reproach you on account of its length.&nbsp; My object is simply
to lead you to ascertain how you regard the things of the Spirit
of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and so to help you to answer
for yourselves the important questions, why you are not more
truly religious, why religion is not with you the one thing
needful.&nbsp; Murmur not, then, at home-thrusts.&nbsp; Plead not
excuses for what is felt to be amiss.&nbsp; Simply answer to
yourselves whether or no your life approves the things of the
Spirit as <i>wisdom</i>; and, if not, be anxious to learn (that
you may profit by the knowledge) <i>why</i> it treats them as
foolishness.</p>
<p>Now, St. Paul tells us, that it is the natural man to whom
these things are foolishness; and the spiritual by whom they are
discerned to be wisdom.&nbsp; In proportion, then, as you receive
them not, or undervalue them, you are natural in
contradistinction to spiritual.&nbsp; And what is it to be thus
natural?&nbsp; It is to regard the things of religion as one doth
other things, from a mere human point of view; and with the
faculties and feelings that belong to our human nature,
independently of the operation on it of the enlightening and
persuading and strengthening influences of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;
It is to attempt to acquaint ourselves with them by natural
observation and scrutiny; to expect to understand them <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>through
natural instruction received into natural ears; to try to picture
them by the exercise of natural imagination.&nbsp; This is to be
natural; and this is what we too frequently are.&nbsp; We get our
religious notions as we do our acquaintance with natural science,
or with secular history: from observation, or reading, or
hearing.&nbsp; We strive to be religious (simply mechanically) by
obeying certain laws, and following certain prescribed courses,
just as we become peaceful subjects or approved servants; aiming
to do what is bidden, to avoid what is prohibited: not from
appreciating the sanction or restriction; not from loving what is
ordered; but simply from following it as appointed and obligatory
obedience.&nbsp; And we get our conception of heaven, of eternal
bliss, of <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself (just as we form
ideas about countries afar off, or men who lived before us), by
putting together for ourselves, and making to assume a shape of
fancy, what we have read or heard about them.&nbsp; It is the
mere man&mdash;the brain, the mind, the human soul, the natural
affections, the unassisted innate energy&mdash;which conceives
and aims at the observance of the things of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Hence the failure.&nbsp; The
natural powers, which alone we use, cannot grasp spiritual
things.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Eye</i> hath not seen, nor <i>ear</i>
heard, neither have entered into the <i>mind</i> of man to
conceive the things which <span class="smcap">God</span> hath
prepared for them that love Him:&rdquo; and yet it is the eye,
the ear, or the mind, which alone we use to discern them.&nbsp;
We have indeed a <i>theory</i> which contradicts our <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>practice.&nbsp; We know of an external power&mdash;the
Holy Spirit, which alone can take of the things of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and show them unto us, and influence us
to love, and enable us to follow them.&nbsp; We know how that
power is to be appropriated, and sustained, and made
effectual.&nbsp; We talk of its imparted gift, and we use certain
words of prayer for its continuance and efficacious working, but
still we go on thinking our own thoughts and doing our own deeds,
as though there were no such power; and we wonder and grieve that
we are not religious; that we do not heartily approve and follow
what <span class="smcap">God</span> has enjoined and
promised.</p>
<p>Believe me, my brethren, or, rather, believe the apostle, it
will never be otherwise till you are thoroughly convinced of the
utter inability of the natural man to discern the things of the
Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>; till your religion
consists of earnest entreaties for Divine instruction and
impulse, of ready, eager use of all appointed means of securing
and vivifying within you the operation of Divine grace, of entire
submission to the Spirit&rsquo;s rule, of watchfulness for His
motions, of zealous co-operation with Him.&nbsp; You may spend
your life in trying to learn and practise religion, and yet be
irreligious after all; unless you renounce all the independent
thoughts and efforts of the natural man; unless you give
yourselves, actively and passively, in all things, to the special
illumination and direction of the Holy Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Trust not to the eye, to the ear,
or to the mind: they cannot inform or influence <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>you.&nbsp;
Trust not, I say, to the eye.&nbsp; People talk of finding out
<span class="smcap">God</span> from the contemplation of His
works; of looking from nature up to nature&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">God</span>; of examining the evidences of religion,
and becoming religious.&nbsp; But who ever found out the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of the Bible from the works of nature;
by the traces of power, and wisdom, and skill, and adaptation,
which it is true are marked upon every part of creation; by
theorising about a first cause; by investigating Scriptural
coincidences, and establishing the authenticity of sacred
history?&nbsp; One of the ablest naturalists that ever lived
ascribed the various forms and functions of animals to chance, to
the operations of winds and streams, to shaping in natural
moulds.&nbsp; One of the profoundest astronomers saw no necessity
for a first cause; and the man who penned perhaps the sublimest
description of our blessed <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> character and career, and the
most cogent argument for accepting Him as the Messiah, concluded
all by saying: &ldquo;And yet I cannot believe in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No! brethren; nature is the <i>handmaid</i> of religion.&nbsp;
It will corroborate what is already revealed; but it is no ladder
to heaven; it is no telescope, to bring near what is afar
off.&nbsp; Look at yourselves, and at all around you, by natural
light only.&nbsp; You perceive Providence, but not love; sin, but
not its remedy; mortality, but not immortality.&nbsp; Read
history, ponder probabilities, accredit testimony.&nbsp; Your
mind will be instructed; your heart, perhaps, touched; but your
spirit will not be quickened.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>It is
for this reason that the advocates of religion protest so stoutly
against harmless, intellectual recreation as a compromise between
godliness and ungodliness; and maintain, on Scripture grounds,
that however sobered, however civilised, however naturally
elevated, the man is not one inch nearer to heaven and spiritual
discernment who spends his Sunday in a crystal palace, or a
museum of nature, than he who riots in a den of infamy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eye hath not seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Neither, again, hath <i>ear</i> heard them.&nbsp; Others, that
is, cannot describe them to us.&nbsp; It was this which made
Paul&rsquo;s preaching foolishness to the Corinthians.&nbsp;
Judges of beauty, lovers of philosophy, fertile imaginers they
were, but they had no spiritual ear; they were not enabled by the
Holy Spirit; and so the preaching of Christianity sounded to them
as some unknown tongue would to us; as unintelligible, unmeaning
jargon.&nbsp; Ask an unlearned man to give you an account of some
abstruse lecture he has heard; and he will be able to tell you as
much as the natural man can tell you of the religious instruction
he has received.&nbsp; He will have caught certain names and
definitions; he will have remembered, that something was to be
thought about <i>this</i>, and something to be done about
<i>that</i>; and, if he is enthusiastic, he will, perhaps,
attempt the thinking and the doing.&nbsp; But he will not have
grasped the subject; he will have no soul to receive it; for the
necessary qualification is <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>wanting&mdash;learning, and love of
learning.&nbsp; And so, when the Bible, or the preacher, sets
forth the things of the Spirit, the natural reader, or hearer,
receives them not, and cannot know them.&nbsp; When Christ was on
earth, and spoke in simplest words, the men who heard Him, even
His own disciples, knew not what He said; and if He were now to
come down from heaven and preach to us, all His instruction, all
his loving remonstrances, all His precepts and promises, all his
glowing pictures of bliss, all His threats of wrath, would be
heard by the mere natural man (by those who are not spiritually
fitted for spiritual instruction) without influence, and all but
without comprehension.</p>
<p>It is most important, brethren, to be convinced of this.&nbsp;
We are all of us too apt to make our religion consist of hearing
sermons; to suppose, that if we listen patiently, and grasp the
intellectual meaning, and feel a little emotion about what is
pathetic and alarming, and have a desire to do something that the
preacher recommended, or to give up something that he denounced,
then that we are receiving the things of the Spirit.&nbsp;
Whereas preaching cannot, under any circumstances, do the least
spiritual good, or at all enlarge spiritual comprehension, unless
the hearers are spiritually prepared.&nbsp; We discourse on
heaven or hell: we put together all that the Bible says or hints
about it; we form a kind of natural picture of a spiritual thing,
and we bid you look at it and consider it.&nbsp; Wherefore?&nbsp;
If you are spiritual, to quicken your spirit; if you <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>are
natural, to speak to you a kind of parable, the meaning whereof
you may be prompted to ask of Him who alone can reveal it, the
Holy Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And so of
all preaching; it is an important means to an end.&nbsp; It talks
to men of <span class="smcap">God</span>, of redemption, of
probation, of the Holy Spirit, of heaven and hell: not with any
hope of thereby revealing to them these things; but only to
convince their eyes, their ears, their hearts, that there is a
kind of knowledge which ought to be had, but which they cannot
take in; and so to stir them up to the inquiring how it is to be
had, and to enlist them in the right effort to obtain it.&nbsp;
Through the ear we arrest the natural man, as the voice of
thunder did Saul on his road to Damascus; we do not sanctify him;
we do not show him the things of <span class="smcap">God</span>;
we only convince him that there is something which he has not
rightly received, or taken into account, and we bid him go
elsewhere, to the Spirit, for instruction and salvation.&nbsp;
The only possible good that a sermon can do, is, by working on
the feelings, or appealing to the understanding, or
cross-questioning the conscience, to stir men up to say: &ldquo;I
will know more of this matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the work of grace
is only then beginning, when the hearer of the sermon becomes a
learner of the Spirit.&nbsp; Ear hath not heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither hath entered into the mind of man to
conceive&rdquo; spiritual things.&nbsp; I need not enlarge on
this.&nbsp; We know, indeed, that the imagination has great
powers; that it forms a very tangible idea of <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>what
neither eye nor ear has had opportunity to discern; that
sometimes it surpasses eye and ear, and succeeds in grasping what
they have but touched.&nbsp; Hence such sayings as, &ldquo;It is
easier to imagine than describe;&rdquo; and such practices as
shutting the eyes, when we want to realise an idea.&nbsp; But
still, in spiritual things, if actual observation and study, if
faithful descriptions by qualified persons, a prophet, an
apostle, the Bible, the Spirit, utterly fail to inform the
natural man, surely he cannot expect illumination from the
fancies of his unassisted imagination.&nbsp; Religious ideas come
into the <i>mind</i> through the eye and the ear; if, then, these
have all along been closed, it must, of course, be empty.</p>
<p>And now, dear brethren, does not all this show you why you are
so little religious?&nbsp; Have you not, all along, been dealing
with the things of the Spirit too much as though they were things
which you could perceive by observation, by investigating their
evidence, by intellectually studying them?&nbsp; Have not you
tried to learn religion as you would a human language, or a
physical science?&nbsp; And have not your highest religious
exercises, your searchings into the deep things of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, been the hearing of sermons; or the
indulging of your reason, or your imagination?&nbsp; What do you
know of religion, which you did not in some of these ways
acquire?&nbsp; How much has the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span> taught you? that Spirit who alone knows
the things of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and who alone can
reveal them; <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>that Spirit which comes not first into the eye, or the
ear, or the mind of man, but into his spirit.&nbsp; How often do
you pray for the Holy Spirit, and strive to prepare yourselves
for Him?&nbsp; What dependence do you place on Him for
guidance?&nbsp; What means do you use to bring Him near; and how
much have you Him in mind while using them?&nbsp; What homage do
you render Him?&nbsp; How do you serve Him?&nbsp; When do you
commune with Him?&nbsp; When you regard nature, is it by the
light of the Spirit?&nbsp; When you read the Bible, is it to
learn what the Spirit will say to you, the Spirit invoked to
speak?&nbsp; When you hear a sermon, do you pray the Spirit,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, declare unto me, unto my
spirit, this parable?&rdquo;&nbsp; When you meditate, is your
supplication, &ldquo;Open thou mine eyes;&rdquo; &ldquo;Except
Thy presence go with me, carry me not up hence?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is
your life&mdash;thoughts, words, and deeds&mdash;directed by the
consideration, &ldquo;If any man will do His will, he shall know
of the doctrine, whether it be of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo;?&nbsp; If not, this is why you
are not really religious; and the remedy is in seeking to be and
do what I have now described.</p>
<p>Only use your spirit as you have hitherto used your eye, your
ear, or your mind.&nbsp; Only put yourselves under the tutorship
of the Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Only seek
to meet Him in appointed places; at public worship, at holy
communion, over the Bible, on your knees.&nbsp; Only seek
instruction from Him, and refer to Him for interpretations and
explanations; <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>and only ask His help to be spiritually used; and order
your life, as far as you can, in accordance with your
prayers.&nbsp; And soon you will be, not smatterers, but apt
scholars of Divine learning; soon you will walk as seeing Him who
is invisible; soon will you <i>know</i> the reality of spiritual
things; and, knowing them, love them and seek for them.&nbsp;
They will cease to be foolishness to you.&nbsp; You will choose
them in every circumstance, as wisdom; you will feel religion to
be the one thing needful; you will make it the business and the
pleasure of your lives.&nbsp; The life of a Joseph, an Abraham, a
Moses, a Job, a David, a Stephen, a Paul, will be found to be not
simply possible, but desirable; the only life worthy of the
name.&nbsp; Obedience will be easy; trust will expel care; love
will cast out fear; selfishness will pass away; temptations will
lose their power.&nbsp; No matter will it be to you, where or
what you are.&nbsp; Prosperity, adversity, honour, shame, power,
weakness, life, and death, will be indifferent to you.&nbsp; If
you live, you will live to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
if you die, you will die to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:
living and dying, in endurance and desire, thought and deed, you
will be the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>.</p>
<p>Brethren, this is what the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">God</span> would make you.&nbsp; That Spirit is
pledged to all of you who ask for Him; He waits to reveal to you
the things of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
